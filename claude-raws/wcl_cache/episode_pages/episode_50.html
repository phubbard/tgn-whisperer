<p>Published on Thu, 10 Oct 2019 06:50:00 -0700</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This podcast episode discusses the history and evolution of Casio's iconic G-Shock watch line. The hosts trace the origins of the G-Shock concept born from an engineer accidentally breaking his pocket watch, which led to the development of the first "triple 10" shock-resistant watch in 1983. They recount how the G-Shock initially struggled in its home market of Japan but exploded in popularity in the U.S. after a famous commercial, eventually becoming a global phenomenon embraced by diverse cultural scenes. The discussion covers major G-Shock milestones and innovations over the decades, examines the brand's incredible price range from ultra-affordable to luxury pieces, and explores what has made the simple but nearly indestructible G-Shock an enduring watch icon.</p>
<p>The hosts also review several specific G-Shock models they have selected, sharing details about their features and value propositions. They express awe at the G-Shock's unparalleled toughness and versatility, deeming it suitable for any adventurous pursuit from diving to space exploration. Overall, the episode is a comprehensive celebration of the iconic G-Shock and its unique four-decade journey in watchmaking.</p>

<td>Hello fellow watch lovers, nerds, enthusiasts, or however you identify. This is the 40 in 20 podcast with your hosts, Andrew and my good friend Everett. Here, we talk about watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like. Everett, how are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You know, I'm okay. Yeah. I'm feeling a little sheepish right now. A little sheepish because we just recorded. Well, we didn't record. We just did about 10 minutes of a show.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Dry run. We had a quick dress rehearsal.  You missed the first cans opening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Oh yeah. That's too bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That's okay. You'll get some more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You'll get some more kids. Uh, yeah, no, I am. Okay. As I was just saying, I have been extremely busy, sick. We've had about two weeks since we recorded cause last week's episode was the good speed episode and we recorded that three weeks ago, several weeks ago. Yeah. So we've had a little bit of a, a little bit of a weird scheduling thing, but this week we're alone. It's just the two of us. You and I. Uh, and, and so that's nice because it's given me some time. These last couple of weeks have been insane with this just, you know, upper respiratory infection and work has been go, go, go, go, go. Um, yeah, so I'm good. I'm good, but I have less energy to talk about how I'm doing.  the second time we record than I did the first time that we didn't record.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That makes sense. I can get behind that because I'm already caught up. I don't need to be re caught up, but I will tell you. Uh, so right now I'm drinking a, uh, seek out real hard seltzer from two towns cider based out of Corvallis and it is cucumber and juniper. I saw that flavor in your fridge and I was like, Ooh, Ooh, I gotta try that. Cause Whenever I see a cucumber flavor thing, I always have pretty low expectations because cucumber is typically not very well executed in the form of a packaged beverage, barring a cucumber crush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I was just going to say that's one of my very favorite beers of all time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But you don't get a lot of cucumber in there. You just get that really bright cucumber, like that brightness of it, but you're not getting cucumber flavor. This you're getting a great blast of cucumber flavor and just a little little underlying of juniper. Yeah. And I dig it. Uh, I'm glad you don't have gin, but I would like to try this with gin in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>What's your, what's your, do you have a go-to gin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Uh, I'm usually at Tanqueray cause it's pretty affordable. Yeah. It's always good. Hendrix is really good. Crater Lake makes a really good gin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Uh, I really like Monopolova's gin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I've never had that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. It's a, Polish company, I think primarily known for their vodkas. But they make a gin that's actually pretty tasty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I had a gin from a distillery just north of here, I think Corvallis area. And I can't remember the name of it. So talking about it here is kind of silly. But they did two varieties. They did a like a mixing varietal that was kind of earthy and junipery. And then they made a varietal to be just like a sipping gin. And it was just really bright and floral. And it was So good. And then they also made like a really traditional one and dry kind of, kind of gin. But that, that sipping gin was, uh, a revelation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And if you'd like to try it, good fucking luck. Cause Andrew can't remember what it's called.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. I don't know. I was at the liquor store and they're like, Hey, sample all of our booze. And I'm like, okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yes, I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. I had like one of each and they had like 12 on the table and they're like, well, we can't give you that much. Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. If you need me to walk away and come back, I'll do that. But why don't we just skip that and I'll just stand here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's good. Yeah. You know, gin has always been a little elusive. A, I don't love it. There's some drinks with gin that I really do like. You know, I love a gin and grapefruit juice. And is that that's not a Greyhound, right? Greyhound is vodka. But gin with grapefruit juice is is one of my one of my go to's. But by and large, I feel like gin is the drink that you drink when you've decided not to argue the alcoholism anymore. You're no longer in denial. You've passed denial. You're just an alcoholic, and you admit it, and you're going to continue to be that, and so you're drinking gin. I feel that way about gin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That's an interesting perspective on it. I would lean towards vodka in a plastic bottle being that settling for alcoholism, or 25-ounce cans of some Varietal of malt liquor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Oh yeah. Well, yeah, that's different. I mean, there's a utility to a, there's a utility to a 22 of, of malt liquor camo, you know, because it's a buck 50 and it'll get you shit faced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I feel like that's exactly what you just described the gin drinker as. Perhaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I dig gins. Are you, are you old enough to have had experience with HRD vodka?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You know, there was a time when I was, I mean, really high school, it was high school, right? Where we'd get hogs, like HRD, which was, I think probably like 13 bucks, 12 bucks for the gallon for the half gallon. Yeah. And, uh, it's terrible. It was terrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>If it comes in a plastic bottle, you probably shouldn't be drinking it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. I mean, with some exceptions, but right. That that's, that's generally what's the one exception.  Oh gosh, I don't know. I mean, they make, they make various alcohols in like travel, you know, good alcohol that they sell them in travel pints or whatever. I guess that's what I was referring to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Most of those are still glass though. Right. If you put it in a plastic flask or in a bladder, or have you ever seen those binoculars that are, that's a flask disguised as binoculars? I have seen that. Something like that. That's a whole, that's a new vessel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's where you put your gin. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>There you go. Watch. Let's see. I think that we'll see.  Sorry, I have to check.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Uh-oh. Is everything okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Eh, no.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I looked at your phone and said, uh-oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, the Chiefs are down 13-9. Patrick Mahomes is not leading in comeback right now, which is what I really need. His performance tonight is kind of my make or break for a fantasy week, but it's whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You know, I've got one team that's definitely going to lose, one team that's definitely going to win, so I haven't even been watching because it was just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I watched all day. That was kind of how my, my Saturdays and Sundays during football season, the whole family is kind of on board with the fact that that's about the only time I really watched TV. So Saturdays and Sundays during football season or for football during daytime, and then everyone's happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Our listeners who have heard you talk about Amazon shows on your other things, like 90% of every week are going to disagree with that last statement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But, uh, no, I mean like during daytime, I watched TV at night with either a wife or alone because she works late a couple nights a week. So that's when I get the majority of my TV consumption in is, uh, when everyone is either gone or asleep in my house and I can watch by myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I dig it. Yeah, I dig it. Well, we're alone this week. We are, which is weird, which is weird. It's been such a fun, a few weeks. And I am hoping, I actually don't think we have anybody lined up right now. So if you're listening to this on Thursday, and you think you might be interesting to come on the show, you just holler at me. We've got some interviews that are sort of tentatively lined up, but there's some dependency on press pieces and whatnot. So it's a little tricky to get everything lined up, especially because this right now is the busiest time of year for micro brands in terms of shows. There's tons of European shows happening right now. And then we run into wind up happening. I mean, there's just in terms of micro brands ability to connect with consumers and connect with industry people right now is the busiest time. So press pieces are a little bit tough to come by right now. And we don't like to do interviews with people without having a press piece in hand, or at least having had it in hand very recently. So Uh, that's kind of been our sticking point. You know, there's been a few people come, come through and say, we'd love to be on the show. I can't get you a piece though. And I think, you know, why don't we wait until you can, um, I'd love to have you on the show too. I think your watches are awesome, but I don't own one and the odds that I'm going to buy one for this show are low. So we'll just wait. So we, we don't really have a ton of stuff lined up right now, but there's a bunch of stuff that I expect to come through at the end of.  And so we're gonna be, we're feast and famine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That's okay. You guys will just have to deal with listening to us again for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. Just the two of us. We can make it if we try.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You and I. But we're talking about watches anyway. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>We're talking about watches. Can't stop us. Can't keep us down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And this is a, this is a topic that we've sort of had penciled in for the better part of a year, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It was on our original sheet of things we ought to talk about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Is that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I love that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. It exists somewhere. It's not in this bag, but I have an archive of all of our, all of my show notes and all of our various, uh, bar napkin conversations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And this is one of the first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Yeah. It's among them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So we're talking about, uh, I don't know, maybe the most, uh, the most accessible and inaccessible and inaccessible legitimate watch line On the face of the earth right now. I think we're talking about Casio G-Shock watches today. Gravitational shock. Gravitational shock. And this is a show that is going to be probably light on the things that you don't know if you have spent any time reading or thinking about G-Shocks. It'll be a refresher course for some of you. For others of you that don't know anything about G-Shocks, hopefully you get some background.  Uh, hopefully you'll learn a little something. I know I felt a little sad in researching for this show, but it kind of knew all this stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. I felt like I kind of knew all of it too, but to codify it and to get it all in one place and realize the simplicity of this brand, like there's a lot of special aspects of G Shock. There's a lot of, a lot of special bits and a lot of really fun anecdotal or anecdotes of this brand, but it's still so young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Yeah, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And they came into the marketplace, and then they blew up, and they've just kind of continued to blow up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>G-Shock is the same age as me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>They peaked and plateaued and hung in there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Just like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. Well, you... I hope you haven't peaked. Because you're still getting better, man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Oh, thank you. Thank you. I hope you... I really hope you haven't peaked.  Because in 1981, two things happened. Exactly, two things happened in 1981. The only things that matter. One, Everett Meadows was born. And two, Kiko Ibe drops his dad's pocket watch walking down the street. Fuck that shit up. Broke into a billion pieces. Was it a billion pieces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Maybe. I like to imagine that it was like, it just exploded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I need a sound effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>He didn't even say it was broken. It just hit the ground and there were so many pieces of it, he just assumed it wouldn't work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>He's like, fuck it. That's gone. Dust to dust. So for those of you who have read an article about G-Shock in the last 15 years, will know that Kikuo Ibe is the godfather, the grandfather, the... The OG. The OG, the genesis of the G-Shock watch.  Andrew said it right. The, the lore of this thing is so absent on detail that you're sure it's, it's an anecdote. And this is the Genesis story, but like all Genesis stories, we realized there's some mythology in this. Um, and, and I don't know, that's not to say I don't believe the story, but you know, I've read this story about the pocket watch being dropped.  50 different times in 50 different iterations and heard interviews with Kiko Uebe talking about it in Japanese translated to English a number of times. And never, never, I don't think have I ever heard him say what type of pocket watch it was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>I never have either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So, so there's that in and of itself is probably not important to the story, but it gives you an idea. This is a, This is a mythology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But maybe, maybe it was just some piece of junk that like was maybe already broken. And when it hit the ground, the crystal cracked. Sure. Or maybe it was some, a family treasure, an heirloom. That's kind of a detail. Like maybe we should email him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. Hey, hey Kikuo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>What kind of pocket watch was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Mr. eBay. I actually think he goes by eBay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I, I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Hey eBay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Hey, hombre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So he drops his dad's pocket watch. And it's sad, sad face, sad emoji.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's interesting, too, he was carrying a pocket watch in the 80s.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah, right. Because that also is like, what? Why weren't you wearing a watch? You were a fucking engineer for Casio. Yeah. Why weren't you wearing a watch? Yeah. So he drops his dad's pocket watch. And sure enough, sad eBay says, you know what I need?  You know what I need? I need a watch that I can drop off my wrist and not have it fucking break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I need a watch that will survive falls that I won't fall, that I won't survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. Yeah. So he, he grabbed some guys, he grabbed some guys, three guys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You know what they call them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Team Tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Team Tough. Project Team Tough. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It has to like, that's the best they could come up with.  Well, it wasn't like Research Group 234. That would even be more exciting than Project Team Tough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Team Tough. I think this thing kind of starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Is it just bad translation, do you think? Do you think it's maybe carries a little bit more meaning in Japanese?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>But maybe, yeah, maybe it was. Yeah, I don't know. Team Tough. You know, it's one of those things that's that's axiomatic now for for what it is. But yeah, it's not the most. It's a letdown. Not the most clever marketing there.  So yeah, grabs these three engineers and says, Hey, we're, we're going to, we're going to make this triple 10 watch, quote unquote, triple 10 resistance. And, and triple 10 D I mean, do you have them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. So triple 10, it's a 10 years battery life, which is interesting that that was one of the criteria they were trying to reach. And I wonder if it was because batteries were, I wonder what the expected, the life expectancy of batteries was that 10 years was this landmark that they had to hit. So 10 year battery life.  10 bar water resistance, 10 meter shock resistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>As in I can drop this watch from 10 meters high. Yeah. And it won't die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. Which is crazy to think of, of now, like that, that seems like a pretty low threshold for what G-Shock has achieved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I don't know. 10, 10 meters is 30 feet, three stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I've watched a video of this guy standing two feet from a wall and, and Randy Johnson, this thing into it.  Picks it up, puts it back on his wrist. America. It's fine. He probably doesn't say America. He probably says Japan or Casio or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Japan! Yeah.</td>

And then finally he gets one that survives and they start working off that and they go to the second floor and drops it and breaks it. And then eventually the third floor and finally one survives and drops it and it sort of survives, but some things are damaged. But that's kind of the, the iterations we're going through in the, in the mythology of, of this, this story where you're imagining this, this, uh, this engineer with his idea, who's having to sneak to bathrooms and clandestinely drop things out windows to test his prototypes, even though we are in a state of the art laboratory. You don't need that.</td>

I think that this, that this research was sort of own, own time, own dollar type of deal. And eventually it got picked up by Casio and we don't know when in the process that was. Certainly it wasn't right at first. And I think when he started, Uh, his ideation for this, it was, you know, wrap the watch in, in rubber bands and drop it. And, you know, so at some point they, they, they were finding, and I think he got a budget, but at first I think it's just him sort of after hours, just MacGyver in it, just thinking through shit and trying to come up with an idea. So that leads to 1983 and the introduction of the DW 5,000. See, I have one more.</td>

<td>Yeah, no, they're probably, who knows? They see a child's rubber ball. And that rubber ball is what gave him his breakthrough idea.  into floating the module inside the watch. Because though the outside of the ball would sustain impact, the rest of the ball was unfazed. But again, why would looking at a rubber ball prompt that?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So the issue was that the, the module was still sustaining the impact. It wasn't floated inside the case, like what the, what became resin and then steel and then resin and all kinds of other layering of materials to protect that and float that movement. And then the buttons attached by cables as opposed to directly interfacing with the buttons. I want to say movement.</td>

<tr>

<td>So that's what they get to. They see the rubber ball. They think, well, we need to float this movement. And so that's what they do. They float the movement of the hollow case, quote unquote, hollow case with a urethane, um, with a urethane sort of sleeve envelope inside of it that houses the movement and these flexible connections from the buttons to the, to the connectors. Um, and that is what becomes the DW 5000 C in April of 1983.  which is the original G-Shock. That is the original.</td>

<td>The 6900s. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I'm the opposite. I think 5600 is the classic. But yeah, so I think interesting. I think this next bit is interesting because although there was a need and the market was there, sales lagged in Japan for this watch. They did not take off the way we might think that they did in Japan in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Cause 1980s style wasn't surrounding this active lifestyle watch. They were all surrounding nice slim dress watches and we're in the midst of the quartz revolution and people are transitioning to quartz watches anyway. So why would I get a digital? Because there's this cool quartz movement that's out and available and it's cheap, it's affordable and they look great. And why would I need to be able to throw my watch against a wall?</td>

<td>So this commercial that Casio, so because of the, uh, struggling G-Shock line in Japan, uh, Casio started reaching internationally to try to market this watch. And there was a commercial. I, I actually didn't get a chance to look it up and I will watch it today. If it's, I'm sure it's still available. That has a hockey player using this G-Shock as a puck. Slapshots it.  Watch is just fine. And people go nuts. People start calling Casio, phones are ringing off the hook. They're writing them letters because they have to write letters to complain in this day and age. But it's happening saying, this is false advertising. This isn't happening. There's no way. It's just impossible. What you're claiming cannot be true. And an early iteration of Mythbusters, air quotes, a news agency picks it up and is like, yeah, that's bullshit. We're going to call it.  And they get a G-Shock. They get a hockey stick.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Well, and I think that that's the part of the story that's kind of ironic that so, uh, The G-Shock sales almost immediately pick up with sort of, I don't know, probably today what we call urban culture. So, um, on the East coast, the, the hip hop community sort of picks it up on the West coast, the surf community, the surf slash skater community picks it up, um, because of utility, um, the hip hop community picks it up because of style. And so all of a sudden we've got this watch that's entrenched heavily into the very hip.  sectors of the United States in the early 80s. And so it becomes this cultural position piece, and that position in urban American culture is what eventually drives its sales in Japan. Yep. Because these young Japanese kids are Yankophiles. They're wearing Levi's, they're buying They're buying Harley Davidson's and at the, you know, these, these intrinsically American things. And so G-Shock takes off with the American crowd. And that idea is what drives sales in Japan, which is fantastic to think about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So terrific. And what's impressive is that G-Shock was able to be so nimble during the trajectory of its growth as to be able to keep up with the culture that was its primary demographic. They was releasing watches in colorways and in styles and marketing campaigns that fit right in with the culture that had accepted it. They weren't trying to reestablish themselves. They were just following the trajectory of the cultures that were already embracing it. And I love that they weren't trying to innovate. They were just saying, Hey, we're here with you here. Here we are. What do you want? We're ready to give it to you.</td>

We're not seeing, you know, the Bud Light Platinum Knight who's upgraded Bud Light Knight for the night. Like that's, that's trying to insert yourself in the culture as opposed to already being a part of the culture and saying, Hey, this is what you want. This is what you're going to get.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. You know, and it's, it's interesting too, because, I think a lot of the Japanese watch culture is so uniquely Japanese. You know, the Japanese dive watch is something that's been developed wholly by these Japanese watch trends. And, you know, when you look at Seiko and what they've done and, you know, watches like the Seiko Sus and, you know, so many things in Japan are so uniquely Japanese to see this watch that is a Japanese and be totally American in terms of its in terms of its iconology, you know, develop this way. I think it's a really neat story. And that is the one part of this story that we're telling today that I didn't know before we started was this.</td>

And I wonder how Casio justifies keeping both of those lineages alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I suspect it's purely marketing. I suspect, because I've had the same thought, you know, we, I think we talked about it on this before we talked about it in our, uh, digitals, maybe digital watches. Did we do a, did we do a triple sensor episode? What'd we do anyway? Yes. We we've talked about, we've talked about this before, but, but I do think it's purely marketing because right.  These triple sensor Protrex are a very obvious offshoot of the things that make G-Shock great. And G-Shock has triple sensor, you know, Casio has got a very, very good, one of the best in the world triple, triple sensor module, and they use it in both Protrex and G-Shock. So I think that it's purely marketing why they would continue to maintain both these lines because Protrex has it.  has its base. And I don't think it's the same base as G-Shock.</td>

<td>I suspect that there's a more distinct group in Japan that is inclined to buy, you know, that Protrek marketing. I know we talked about this, but that Protrek logo, even today. Oh, yeah. Unchanged. Is basically unchanged. You know, they've got that green writing. It looks like The brand, it looks like a 1980s Seattle outdoor wear branding. Looks like Jansport. Jansport, that's right. Or the one that pops into my head is Traeger. Traeger is a, not the grill company, but the bag company. And it feels to me very similar to the branding of Traeger or Outdoor Research or something like that. So I suspect that they've got a niche of people that like that brand.  Um, and so they maintain it. And, and I, I would guess that in Japan, that's more distinct than it is here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Maybe. When I was, uh, one of the things I want to look for was all the places G-Shock specifically has been, which is kind of hard to find. You would think that on the, like that G-Shock would be funding and in part sponsoring a lot of these major expeditions or record-breaking, uh, adventures just because their watches are so versatile and durable, and they can go anywhere, do anything. What I could find though, it has been a space. We've talked about that. Yep. G-Shock's been a space. Not to the moon. No, but to space. To space, yeah. Space. A lot. Yeah. Maybe more than any other brand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You know, I think that that's right. I think that now, since about 2014, the official space watch is the X-33, but But it seemed like there was a period of time between 2014 and maybe the 80s, sometime in the 80s, where G-Shocks were 90% of all the watches that the astronauts were wearing. I suspect most of those were personally owned POVs, as it were. POWs? POWs. Maybe something different. But yeah, I suspect those were, you know, I own this because I bought this and I'm going to wear it to space.  It does seem like there was a period of time where more G-Shocks were in space than any other watch.</td>

<tr>

<td>Just a regular dude. Well, so I think that, you know, the next sort of major step that happens with G-Shock is 1987. And this isn't a major step for G-Shock so much as it is a major step looking back. So 1987, G-Shock releases the DW-5600C.  DW-5600C is the same watch that you can get for 60 bucks on Amazon today in the DW-5600E. And there's obviously some minor differences, some minor tweaks, but this watch is the same for all intents and purposes as the basic G-Shock that you buy today. When you, when you say, I want to buy my first G-Shock on WatchuSeek, I have about 80 bucks to spend.  you're going to get about 15 recommendations for the 5600E. You're also going to get some recommendations for the 6900. Those are wrong.</td>

I think something like 30 years.  that the same watch has been the coolest, one of the coolest watches that you can buy as an entry-level collector or whatever, right? I mean, this is similar to the Speedmaster.</td>

You know, the price point does a lot for this, but it's so much more transcendent than just I mean, just about anything else, right? You know, the Speedmaster, I just made that Speedmaster comparison, because I think it's interesting. The Speedmaster is virtually unchanged, different bracelets and upgrades and movements. But the Speedmaster today is the same as the Speedmaster of 1960. It's the same watch. The G-Shock's not quite as old. But essentially, the G-Shock 5600E that you buy today is the same as that 5,000 seed that you could buy when it first came out in 1983. It's the same.</td>

<td>You know, we mentioned it briefly also, G-Shocks are space watches. You know, that's the last sort of very cool thing I'd like to say about G-Shocks. Since 2014, the X-33, the Omega, I don't think it's the Speedmaster X-33 anymore, but the Omega X-33 has been sort of the official watch, and so everybody on the ISS and in the space programs is wearing these X-33s, and I suspect that there's some financial reason for that. I assume that Omega's sponsoring that, but if you look at- I hope so. Yeah. Shit. Right. If you look at pictures of astronauts from the 2000s and the 90s, they're all wearing G-Shocks.  And there's a number of G-Shocks that have been space certified. The DW-5600C, the 5600E, the 5900, the 6900, and the G9000, which is a Mudmaster, I believe, to name a few, are all or have been space certified at some point by NASA. So it should go without saying that a watch that can go to the bottom of the ocean or that can be dropped from 10 meters up Um, it is going to be as good for space as say smacked by a hockey stick. That's right. That's right. So, so they are basically made for the type of things that's going to happen in space. I know at some point NASA shot a, a watch up on one of these, um, weather balloons and it went super, super, super high, uh, you know, way the fuck up there. I don't know. And comes down. So I think it was like 12 hours at negative 56.  Celsius, which is cold. That's really cold, which is cold. Um, and you know, 56 kilometers an hour coming back down, um, hits the ground on a, on a parachute, obviously, but totally survived this thing. You, you know, these things are purpose built for the hardest, hardest points of life or, or, or beyond that, beyond life doesn't survive that. And, And so it should come as no surprise that these G-Shocks are perfect space watches.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And that's the difference. It's what you're thinking of when you think of the OG G-Shock, but it's the solar. And last up the G9300-1.  Frogman. Yeah. And I, I dig this one. Mudman. Yeah. Yeah. Mudman. Sorry. The Mudman. You chose a Frogman. Had me confused, but a Mudman. And it is so simple. It's, it's a round G-Shock. It has compass built into it. I mean, it's, it's got everything. It's, it is one of those watches that if you have to buy one watch, you are in a outdoor pursuits type life and you need some ABC functionality.  and need a watch that you can throw into a rock face.</td>

<td>This could be it. So what are the prices on these? So, oh yeah, sorry.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So 5,600, 5,600, you're coming, you're, you're going to get 9,395 on the Amazon. Okay. Uh, the 5,610, 84 on the Amazon and the Mudman 131 on Amazon. And that's, that's coming in about 131, 192 money.  That's what you're going to pay that for a Suunto. You're going to pay that for a Protrek. It's right in that competitive line with these other tactical watches, but it looks so classic 80s. Yeah. You're not getting that real high-tech looking Suunto or even the high-tech looking Protrek. You're just getting this clunky 80s G-Shock.</td>

<tr>
<td>Unknown</td>
<td>Oh yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. Yeah. So, so the first one, this is the GF8235D Frogman. This is a blue Frogman. Frogman watches are known for their asymmetrical cases. So if you've seen this G-Shock that's sort of got a pronounced left side Uh oh.  I know I'm a little bit anti-Black G-Shock, which is... I think it's from my time in the Army watching Joe wear... They don't wear... Black G-Shocks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>They wear like FDE and OD and camouflage and coyote.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah, that too, but it's just so pedestrian. The Black 6900s, even the Black 5600s, I find them pedestrian and it turns me off a little bit.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I hear that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So I've got a Navy blue frogman. The second watch I have now you can, you can find these, you can find these, but they're a little tricky and there's one really good reason why they're tricky. So this is a 1996 MRG JDM titanium case. It's the MR-G 210T.  Uh, now this is a square case, titanium JDM G-Shock. Uh, and it's semi-square. It's not square square. It's semi-square, a little curvy square. Uh, these things are the shiznit and I have looked for one of these, no shit, for about three years, for about three years. And they are very, very tricky to find.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>No, they're not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>They're always available on eBay.  There's always about one or two on eBay, and they stay on eBay for a very long time. And the reason is Japanese people have skinny wrists, little tiny wrists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You can't ever find a bracelet greater than six inches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's right. So I think probably what I need to do is buy two of them. And you and I have talked about this before, and maybe we've even talked about this on the show before, have we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I don't know if we've talked about it on air,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I think what I need to do is buy two of them. Take the best parts from both and combine the bracelets. But you cannot find these with a bracelet over about six inches and three quarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, that's that's because I sometimes lurk on eBay and OfferUp and places like that. So I can buy one and have it and then you can't have it.</td>

<td>I would be so fucking mad at you.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>

<td>It's my grow watch.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I was like, why do you need a grow watch? I'm a grower. But yeah, no, I've looked for them. Not a shower. The bracelets, no, well, the bracelets are always just tiny. And is it that When these watches were produced, people were like, ah, whatever. It cost me 60 bucks. I'm just going to throw away these links.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Well, they were 60 bucks. They were expensive because they're titanium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Or it's like these damn Casio bracelets that just break apart when you try to adjust them. Like that world time, that's the size it is forever. It is never adding or removing any links ever again because it got fucked up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>No, these things have replaceable links. I mean, they're meant, it's just very, very difficult. I think two things. One, I think people recognize them as collector's pieces.  And so people kind of hang on to them. And two, they're JDM. People in Japan have little wrists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>These guys in their JDM watches, man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Motherfuckers. So that is, if I have a grow watch, it's that one. And I have had an alert set up on eBay for the better part of the last two years. And I promise when one comes up with a bracelet long enough, I'll buy it. But I'm guessing I just have to buy two.</td>

<td>And the ones that do pop up, like I've seen a couple that were in really good shape, but they're still too grandish.</td>

<td>Mm-hmm.</td>

<td>It's the one G-Shock I own. You have a baby G. Oh, that's true. Yeah. That's true. Well, I mean... There's a baby G in this house. There's a baby G in this house. This is my personal... Franken-watch. My personal perfect G-Shock.  It's my perfect G-Shock. And that is a white cased GWM 5610. But you cannot buy the one I'm wearing. And that is because it is got a module from the GWM 5610, the sort of vanilla, everyday black strapped GWM 5610, which is the red ring, that sort of purple solar panel.  with a positive display.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>A positive display. And that came with a negative display, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>This came with a black-on-black negative display. This white case did. Because G-Shock, in their infinite wisdom... Who makes a watch for everyone on the planet... Does not sell a white GWM with a positive display right now. So, to make this watch, I had to buy two watches. I had to buy the GWM 5610MD, which is a white braceleted, white bezeled, positive, or excuse me, negative display. And I had to buy a GWM 5610-1, the sort of OG GWM, and I had to just swap them out. Now the mod took about 15 minutes from both watches because you unscrew the bracelet, you sort of unscrew these little bezel clips, pull the bezel off, you, you know, drop one into the other and screw it all back up. I mean, 15 minutes for this mod, but I ended up, I mean, it's the most rewarding mod ever because I ended up with something that's totally OEM that then totally not. That's right. That's right. It's totally OEM. It looks like it's an off the shelf G-Shock. It doesn't have any, you know, a lot of these Seiko mods. It's like, that's cool, but it doesn't look OEM. It looks like a mod.  This does not look like a mod. It's just, and it's exactly what I wanted. It's so satisfying to put a watch on that's exactly what I wanted when what I wanted didn't exist. That's, there's something so satisfying about that. This is my weekend watch. I wear this. You wear it a lot. A lot. It's probably top three, top four in my collection in terms of wear time. And I never wear it during the week.</td>

I can't believe how many watches they have. That's the most shocking thing to me, is that they're still viable with almost 200 active lines.</td>

But I also think that there's a lot, not, not a small amount of underrated-ness that, that happens with G-Shock. I mean, this is literally the toughest watch on earth.</td>

The answer always could be G-Shock at least, you know, I need a watch that's going to be attractive with work clothes. That's a stretch, maybe, but $5,600. I need a watch that's going to be inexpensive and good for kicking around on the weekend that also has street cred. $5,600. $5,600. I need a watch that's going to be able to be on my watch 100% of the time in the pool, in the shower, out in the rain, doing yard work. $5,600.  I mean, it's, it's literally a watch capable of doing anything. I want to go diving. I want to go to space. I want to, I don't know, be able to survive a zombie apocalypse.

I'm really surprised that we're not so diamond league is, is starting to pick up and become cool. Uh, but it's slower than I'm, I'm, I'm a little surprised that track and field hasn't gotten more of a following. I think the YouTube, the YouTube angle, the YouTube pivot is going to be, is going to be big for track and field.</td>

<td>I think it'll help. I think part of the, uh, It's chaotic in that it's totally chaotic. You don't know what events are going on at what times. There's 40 different events associated with track and field and it doesn't have the same. It's hard to get behind a team the same way it is, but any other sport like you can, I don't, well, I don't understand cricket at all. No, me either, but I kind of like watching it. That's, that was the first sport that came to mind that I didn't know any of the rules.</td>

<td>Yeah. Yeah. I don't understand the rules. I don't know how it works, but I kind of like watching it and you can get behind a team. You can, you can see a team kind of coming together and an individual sports, unless people are like beating the shit out of each other, It's kind of hard to enjoy an individual sport. Sure. Maybe that's part of that.</td>

<td>I know. I mean, I love tennis. Love it. OK, I've got another thing. Do it. I don't think I've ever talked about this on the show, but I'm always blown away by how cool this thing is. So Anchor is a company I know we've talked about. A N K E R. They're available on Amazon and I think increasingly other places. But Anchor is a Chinese company. They are priced like a Chinese company. So if you want anything electronic. If you want Bluetooth headphones, if you want a Bluetooth speaker, if you want a car, a car USB, you know, a cigarette lighter, they make the best. Power banks. They make the best. That's what we've talked about on the show before is the power bank. But I've got a Bluetooth speaker. Mine is the Anker Soundcore 2. And this thing, it's kind of got a grippy rubber texture on it. It's solid. It's small.  It's about the same size as the Jabra version. And it costs $35. I think that the Jabra version is like $150-ish. That sounds right. And people love it. It's Bluetooth connection. My Anker Soundcore 2 was $35. I've had it for three years. I use it almost every day. And here's where I use it. I put it on the top of my shower door.  Oh, yeah, there's like an aluminum frame on my shower. And I set it up there. And so it gets steam and splash and wet. And it has never hiccuped.</td>

<td>I charge it every couple of days because I'm only using it for, you know, 45 to 60 minutes a day when you shower less than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right. Yeah. So, you know, a half hour ish, you know, I'll put on Scottish watches or whatever or Bellingham podcast or whatever is, you know, next up in my queue.  and get in the shower. It's been through it, man. I mean, short of using it poolside, I don't think you could use this thing a lot harder than I've used it. We have used it poolside. And we have used it poolside, literally in Mexico. I mean, it is insanely good. It's insanely good. The quality of the sound is fantastic. It's everything I would expect. I've had other Bluetooth speakers that I did not love as much in terms of sound.  It's fantastic, and I don't think we've ever talked about it on the show, and I just thought if you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker, something to connect to your phone to give you a little bit better than phone audio.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Much better than phone audio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It is what you should buy. And I don't say that lightly. It is the one you should buy. Just buy it. Just buy it. Even if you don't think you need a Bluetooth speaker, actually just buy this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You'll soon find out that you need</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You know, there's and so we're not sponsored. Obviously, I'm not getting paid to say this. There's a there's I think it's called the Cove. There's a Bluetooth speaker that all these YouTubers pimp because Cove is they give out sponsorships. I've never used it. I don't know what it is. I know it's more expensive than the anchor, and I know that the anchor is better. Boom. I know it's better. Has to be better. Anchor Soundcore. The one I have is the two. I think they may have a newer version by the newest version you can.  It's fantastic.</td>
