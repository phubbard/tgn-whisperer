<p>Published on Wed, 22 Jul 2020 22:20:00 -0700</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This is a podcast where two friends, Andrew and Everett, discuss their picks for a 3-watch collection within a budget of $600. They go through their individual selections, which include affordable watches from brands like Bernhardt, Seiko, Scurfa, Orient, Seagull, and Citizen. They also mention some honorable mentions that didn't quite make the cut, like the Hamilton Khaki King, Casio Duro, Vostok Komandirskie, Timex MK1, and others. Additionally, they touch on some non-watch-related topics like an article about NASA's Hubble telescope repair, an offer from Katz's Deli in New York for a "Game Day" package of cured meats and bread, an article about the decommissioned Kepler space telescope, and the release of the Beastie Boys autobiography.</p>

<td>Hello fellow watch lovers, nerds... Wait, start again so you don't hear me. Break. Hello fellow watch lovers, nerds, enthusiasts, or however you identify. This is the 40 in 20 podcast with your hosts Andrew and my good friend Everett. Here we talk about watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like. I will have to start off by saying please do forgive the scratchy throat. My wife brought home a mild disease that I have contracted, so You can look forward to having that in the next week. How are you doing, Everett?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I'm doing all right. Yeah, doing really well. Been a cool learning week, first publishing our first podcast. Learned a ton about iTunes and RSS feeds and sound editing, all these things that I'd never thought about. So, yeah, I'm doing really well. I've got a little scratchy throat myself. I feel like maybe, I don't know if it's</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>psychosomatic it could be i appreciate your sympathy sickness uh yeah and i appreciate you doing all the sound editing because um that's not really my cup of tea so i'm glad that you're a tinkerer just like me and but you you look better and sound better so not currently but typically yeah so this week we're doing uh i think something pretty cool uh and i um I mean, it's a pretty basic idea for two people talking about watches is basically the premise. We have 600 bucks. What are we buying? Uh, and, you know, kind of focused around building a collection. I know I pro I took an approach. It's probably slightly different than yours. So, um, you want to kick us off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, sure. So the, uh, as you said, the premise was to build a three watch collection with 600 bucks. We did set some ground rules, the, Oh yeah.  The main ground rule is that we had some off-limit watches and they'll probably come as no surprise. We said we didn't want to be able to pick the SKX007 or 009, the Seiko, ubiquitous Seiko divers. No Orient Mako, no Seiko SNK, and no Vostok Amphibia mods or stock models. And I think the reason for that is I think the reason we agreed on those watches is because we knew we would probably both pick them, and so we were hoping to build a little bit more variety into our collection and to force ourselves to think a little bit more than those pretty easy decisions. And I will say, my decisions that I made today are totally different because I started at that place where I couldn't get a Seiko or I couldn't get a Mako. Did you find that as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah, I had a really similar experience. I was also trying to take the perspective of if someone gave me today $600 and I was only allowed to spend it on watches, what I would do next. And what I, what I look for in a watch is something that has a little bit of diversity. It's something that looks good almost regardless of where you're wearing it. And obviously there's limitations, you know, some, some, most watches you're not going to take into the ocean and dive. I'm also not going to take me into the ocean and dive. So that's not really as relevant, but I, I, that was kind of how I looked at it. I took it from the position of, all right, I'm going to add three watches to the collection. This is my budget.  What am I going to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And I think I started, in my head, I imagined having lost my whole collection and gotten a $600 payout from insurance or whatever. What would I do? I should hope you get more than $600. Well, yeah, maybe. We'll see. So yeah, I guess I'll kick it off. What we're going to do, we're just going to each go through our list. So I'll kick it off with my first watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Also, wait, I'm going to interrupt you. For the record, neither of us have seen each other's list.  All we've done all week is text each other the totals that we've been at as we've developed our list. So I am really excited to see what you've got on there. And I'm also intrigued to see if there's any overlap. There was a couple watches that I was like, did this maybe make it to your list? And got a negative response. So my assumption is that we don't have any overlap. So I'm excited to see what we've got cooking here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I'd be surprised if there was any overlap. I would be too, actually. So the first watch I picked is...  I think one of the most underrated watches, or at least one of the most underrated watch brands in the affordable world, it's a watch from the Bernhardt watch company. Fred Amos makes Bernhardt watches, and I think Bernhardt watches are one of the very sort of first, the pioneers of micro brands. They're priced incredibly competitively. Most of their sort of basic three hand watches come in between 300 and 400 in that range. Um, but my first watch was the Bernhardt binnacle ankle anchor three. It's a, uh, $259 watch. It's not the most current iteration, although they're still in stock. I think there's subsequently been a four. There's some very minor differences just in, in details and styling. And I think you couldn't go wrong with either, but it's a Rolex Explorer, uh, Rolex Explorer, homage for sure. And that actually gave me quite a bit of hesitation in this pick because I'm sort of, uh, I I'm sometimes negative about homage watches, but at the end of the day, it's such a well-featured watch. Uh, and it fits so well into our price, uh, our price scheme here that I couldn't not pick it. So I picked this watch to be sort of the anchor of the collection and it's called an anchor.  There's that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Will you show me the picture finally?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Oh yeah. I'm supposed to do that. Um, it's a 40 millimeter case, um, steel bracelet. And, and you know, I, I've never actually handled one of these things, but from what I, uh, from what I understand, these, these bracelets are phenomenal. So the one thing I don't love about this watch is besides the homage feature, the end links are actually, Hooded. So it's not a fitted end link. There's a hood that fits over. So this, what would normally be an end link is actually connected to the case. It's a, it's a hood that's part of the case. I don't know what I think about it. I haven't handled it. People don't seem to have a huge problem with it. It seems a little weird to me though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I think I'd have to put my hands on it, but just looking at that, it looks like a rendering that we're looking at online.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You know, I think it's an actual photograph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Oh, that definitely is. I think it it's a cool look. It's something that I've not really seen before. I think it's just a cool little kind of quirk to it. I like watches that have some personality, and I think that's got enough personality that it's not standing out or being weird. It's just got just a little a little quirk to it, just a little bit of personality that makes it its own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>When it's very much in the vein of the Rolex Explorer. I mean, the the font here is I don't know if it's identical, but it's nearly identical to a Rolex Explorer. Obviously, we've got an extra number here. The Explorer doesn't have the 12, it's only got the 369. But other than that, nearly identical. It's Miura 8215, solid movement, solid end links here. It's just a really sort of well-featured watch for the price. And I figure it's an anchor, it's that dress That dress tool watch that we talked about nicely signed case back sign crown. I think everything I'd want in an everyday day-to-day watch if I could, you know, if you can get past the watch feature. Some people don't like Mercedes hands doesn't bother me at all. So that was my first watch $259, which is the which is the most expensive watch that I've picked and I think it's featured. It's featured really well at that price point. That's a good start. I like it.  So the second watch, I'm going to skip around here. This is an interesting watch. You know, I think that this is another sort of chronically underrated, chronically underrated watch. It's the Seiko SSB027. And there's several of these. So there's 027, 025, 031, 033. There are all this line of tachymeter sort of racing chronographs in the Seiko Mecaquartz line. So the Mecaquartz movement, for those of you who don't know, is a quartz movement, battery operated, but with a functional mechanical quartz module on top that runs your chronograph. So it's a 60 minute chronograph, so not the longest chronograph ever. It also comes with a 24 hour Subdial, I don't know how much I love that. It's maybe seems like a bit of a throwaway to me, but yeah, whatever. It's something cool It's got that snappy. I think it's a one-fifth or a one-fourth second Big hand big second hand on the chronograph and it's mecha quartz so snaps back to zero unlike a true quartz chronograph 40 millimeters Which is great size 20 millimeter bandwidth The colors, this, this is probably the most wildly colored one. I do like the steel bezel. That lime green might not be for everybody and might not be for every day. If you didn't like it, there's also a white, there's a black and red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I think the lime green kind of fits what it's trying to, that racing feel, just kind of a, you're not going to buy a black muscle car. You're getting red, you're getting something bright that stands out. And I think that, that fits that, that racing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>feel to that watch that's a i like that watch i don't know that i would wear it but i i think that's a that's a good color scheme on a watch with that that idea in mind well and i i think actually the 40 millimeter size so i think when you pick up pictures of these uh it's hard to picture what it would look like smaller um you know it's a metal bracelet steel bracelet on this thing i assume that bracelet's not um not all that great you know i've got notes here and i'm not reading from them but Yeah, there's nothing on here. Halloween links. 430 date window. Oh yeah, that's that's the other thing I'm not sure I love. There's that 430 date window. It's it almost just disappeared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It's kind of a cluttered dial. I did not notice that there was a date window as I'm looking at. It's got those three sub dials. I didn't even notice the date window at the 430 position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So as I'm sitting here now, I realize I should be reading my notes that the other thing about that binnacle anchor, my first watch pick. It's a 200 meter watch. It's a.  a full-on dive watch specification. 200 meters, killer bracelet, sapphire, super-luminova. You know, it's a watch that you can do anything in. That movement, that 8215, has a weird movement thing where the second hand shudders if you bump it, but from what I understand, it does not affect the longevity or the durability of the movement at all.  Um, super, super durable. This is similar. It's not a 200 meter, it's a hundred meter, but, uh, still a ton of water resistance. You're not going to, you know, unless you leave the crown out or something you can wear in the shower, you can wear in the pool. It's not gonna, it's not gonna leak unless you've got a bad seal or something. Um, talking now about the SSB, the 027, the chronograph. I just, I like the functionality of it. Um, And I think a three watch collection should have a chronograph. Um, and maybe someone might disagree with me on that, but it seems like a three watch collection. It seems like a real obvious, uh, a real obvious choice. Not that anybody, anybody needs that. It just feels like I should have that. Yeah. So 119 bucks on that one. Well, this is 123. I pulled it up for 119. So I'm going to be fine. Even at 123, I'm okay. So, um, super well-priced there. You know, the 100 to 150 price range is a little bit of a weird price range. So trying to find watches in there, a little bit tricky. This is the one that popped up and I thought, oh, that's a no brainer. The size is perfect. It's also hard to find watches that aren't like 48 millimeters.  at that price range. It seems like everything just wants to be super big. So yeah, that's, that's watch two. Um, so I've got my sort of field watch in the Bernhard Binnacle anchor. I've got my chronograph and of course every three watch collections going to have a diver. I went with the Scurfa, the Scurfa diver one. This watch is only comes in pound price monies, so you'll just have to believe me when I say 156 pounds to the US is approximately $203. Yeah. I won't get out the calculator, but I promise. I trust you it's a neighborhood. In that neighborhood, which actually keeps me pretty low. I think total that keeps me at 581, which gives you, you know, enough money to buy a NATO on Amazon or to pay for shipping for your SCRFA 1, which is coming from England. That's right.  You know, this watch is one of those watches that, you know, being an automatic guy, I've not spent a ton of time with, but it's made by a real diver, a commercial diver. It's got a really sort of simple classic, I don't know, maybe sort of Comex style sub case, but without being an homage.  I love the hooded lugs on here. 300 meters. It's just a no shit diver is what it is. Tons of water resistance. Quartz movement. You know, it's got the Ronda 515, which I think is their, Ronda's sort of middle of the road, everyday beater quartz movement. It's not fancy. It's a plated quartz movement.  super durable swiss quartz sapphire obviously drilled lugs on this for easy strap changes 120 click unidirectional uh bezel 12 month warranty this rubber strap is uh i think an mbr rubber i just a great watch and it won't surprise you when i tell you it's a 40 millimeters 40 millimeter case 20 millimeter lug width who saw it coming who saw it coming and i promise i didn't pick watches based on that that just sort of happened Um, for me, it's the perfect size. You know, obviously I have watches that are both bigger than that and smaller than that, but there's, I don't think no matter what kind of watch it was, maybe a dress watch, a really formal dress watch that might be a little big, but anything else, 40 millimeters is going to work on just about on just about anybody, you know, unless you're Andre the giant or something. 40 millimeters is going to be great. So these watches all came in right there. These are all with the exception of maybe the Seiko, Um, certainly the Bernhardt, certainly the Scurfa, sort of Cinderella forum favorites, you know, not the first one people name, but, but when it does get named, everyone's like, oh yeah, it's a good watch. So that's it. That's my three. I came in 580 or so, so a little bit under, um, two quartz watches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Depending on the exchange rate for the day, obviously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That's right. Yeah, that's right. Um, But two quartz watches, which is... Unusual for you. Surprised me. Yeah, it surprised me. I gotta say, trying to pick a dive watch at significantly less than, you know, 250, 300 that needed to come in here and not having the ability to go make or SKX, I found that really tough. I got one. All right. Well, so those are my three. What do you got?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>All right. So going into my list, let's pull this Let's pull this page up. Number one, the Orient second generation Bambino version one, ringing in at $135. That's a great watch. So like I said, my philosophy on this was, okay, what are the, if I get $600 today that I have to spend on watches, what I want to do is I want to grow the collection of watches that I have. I want to grow with, Um, a little bit of diversity in it. I don't, and, and I was excited to cut those watches that we did cut on. We put them on our off limits list. Uh, cause a, we, I, I either have some of them or I have pretty easy access to them. Should I find a need to, or a desire to wear it? So what I want to do is just diversify what I've got, uh, got at the house. So I went, uh, my first pick was obviously the second generation Bambino version one at $135. Um, and what I like about it is just, it's simple. Mm.  I've got the white face up with a silver case. It's a 40.5 millimeter case, 21 millimeter lugs, and 11.8 millimeter thickness. It's a little bit of a weird size at 40.5 and 21 millimeters, but that thickness that I really like. It's going to be a nice thin. Then if you look at the profile view of it- Did you say 21 on the strap?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. That is weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right?  I'm okay with it. Like I said, like I said earlier, I kind of like that. Just that's a little bit of quirk to it. The only unfortunate part about that is you've got to find a strap for it that you really like on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I know a guy, I know a guy that can make you one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I do know a guy who can make, actually I'm wearing one of those right now. That's a good one. Good strap. Um, but what I really like about it is it's a very simple, very sharp, like just an elegant looking, simple, inexpensive watch. Yeah.  The F6724 movement, so it's auto handwinding, hacking. I mean, to find an automatic at that price point, especially from a company that we know makes such quality watches already, I just don't think you can go wrong with getting a simple watch from them like this. Three o'clock date window on it. And when I first saw it, as I was pulling it up, one of the first things that I thought of was the Seiko Sarb. Just with the way the hands pop and come to that really, really precise point on them, It looked reminiscent of the SARB to me as I was looking at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Those chamfered sword hands. Uh, yeah, no, it's a, it's a super beautiful watch. I love the applied, the applied indices for 135 bucks and automatic applied polished indices. Um, yeah, I, I think it's really great. You know, the, the one thing about this watch, I'm looking at it right now, uh, the hands are a little short.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>They are a little short, but, um, I think they contrast enough that I'm okay with it. They come... They almost come out to that ring, which is sort of set in... Yeah, two-thirds of the way to the edge of the dial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I don't think it really affects legibility. It's a clean enough dial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And there's nothing on it. You have really simple markers on it, the Orient logo, 3 o'clock date window, and there... I can't read what it says on there.  water water resistant yeah i think it probably says water resistant on it um yeah that's uh that's my first pick uh it's a i think just a really clean watch that you can add into your collection and it doesn't stand out it's something that you know is is going to be a win and finding an automatic watch at that price point and most anybody who looks at it is going to not notice it because you can wear virtually anything and unless you bump into another watch nerd, they're not going to notice what you're wearing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Um, yeah, no, it's a great choice and it, it definitely was written down on my list. Uh, was it? Oh yeah. And obviously it didn't make the final cut, but, uh, yeah, I think it's, I think it's a great watch. I think it needs to be in the conversation here.</td>

<td>I have, I have some room to play. Almost 500 bucks. This one's going to surprise you a little bit. The Seagull 1963. So what I was able to find here on Island Watch, uh, the Hanwha Mechanical Chronograph with acrylic crystal. It's the 6345A-2901 ringing in at $299.  And that same philosophy that you took, that if you're going to have a three watch collection, you got to have a chronograph. I had the same philosophy on it. Um, I like hand wine only mechanicals. I think it's a, just a cool feature. Um, and I really liked these 1963s. They've been on my radar of, of something to get for quite a while. I've seen the Seagull, I've seen the, the gamut of 1963s that are out there and available, but within the confines of this exercise, uh, This is what I went with. I like that throwback, that military-style watch. As you know, I like the Russian watches, the Chinese throwback that's out there. For some reason, they speak to me. It's got a cool color contrast on the dial. Even with that white dial, you've got the gold markers for your hours, the blue hour and minute hands, the red second hand, and then the chronograph function on there.  Not having handled it, I'm still pretty sure I'd like that watch.</td>

<td>HK Ed. But from the horse's mouth or from the horse's fingers as he typed it, I've got the HK Ed version of this, the 38mm version, which I think is shipped from Hong Kong for $260. So you did yourself, you played yourself in the words of DJ Khaled. I did. You lost some money here. I'll let you make a last minute substitution if you want. I'll save $30. You know, I don't think actually Ed's got the blue hand, red second hand version of this. I could be wrong.  Ed is one of the things, the Red Star versus the HK Ed logo. I do really like this.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And so is this the 38 millimeter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>This is, so this is a 42 millimeter case with 22 millimeter lugs, 13 millimeters thick, which was a little big, not having worn.  42 before But I know I looked at them in the 30 in the 38 in the 42 This was ultimately the one I went with because well the price and I did not even think to look at each kids because I know you have His in well, they're 38.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>They're super similar that 38 though wears Really? Well, I'm really happy with the way that wears. I haven't had on the 42. So I Think that the way that case I think the way the case sets it would be fine in either size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I think that's enough for a $300 watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So what movement is this having in it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It's the, uh, the ST-19.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, that's the same. That's the same movement in the 38. It's, it's a really fun movement. You know, when I got mine, um, I, when I got mine, it wasn't, it wasn't operating. I'd wound it up and it was, it would run for a little bit and then stop. And I, I wrote Ed and I was like, man, what, what's happening? And I think it was just time. It had just sat for a little bit. And so I needed the, I don't need a break-in period. Oils to be redistributed through that movement or to be distributed, maybe, I'm not sure. But now it runs like a dream. You wind it, you wind it once. It's got that winding feel so nice. You know, a Chinese movement, you know, when people think about the movement arguments are, you know, Swiss or Japanese, very rarely do you hear someone say, what's better, Swiss movements or Chinese movements? But I will say for a hand wind, for a hand cranker. That ST-19 has been really, has been nothing but good for me. I love it. I love the way it feels to wind it. Um, the pushers feel awesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>The push. Yeah. The pushers on that feel really great. And it's just, it's a fun watch. Yeah. I like a good pick. All right. Moving on to number three. Here's the diver we talked about. Oh yeah. The citizen men's eco drive pro master diver.  Model number on that is BN0150-28E with the four o'clock date window. Ringing in at $163.99. Which brings my total to $597.99. So I've got... Three bucks. Two bucks. Two bucks. Two and change. So I'm going to get a big gulp.  So I've looked at the Promaster. One of the things that I like about it is I like that EcoDrive movement. Like we've talked about, I have one of the EcoDrive movements. I like that function because I don't like batteries. So I either want to hand wind my watch, I want it to wind on my wrist, or I want the sun to power it. So I'd pick the Bambino and the 1963 first. So I was looking with a relatively limited budget and recognize that in the three watch collection, I've got a, I've got a chronograph. I've got a, I think a dress tool watch can fit for that Bambino. It's fairly inexpensive. It looks elegant. It looks nice, but it's not something that would be tragic to wear in an everyday activity. So I wanted to add a diver into the, into the mix here. So Looking across the divers, the Promaster Diver has been on my radar for a while. We've talked about it probably a couple dozen times over the last year. It comes on that silicone strap. Just a really good-looking, bulky diver. It's a 43mm case, 20mm lugs, and it's 12mm thick. It's using their EcoDrive E168 movement.  standard 200 meter water resistance. And just a good, nothing extraordinary, a really basic diver that if you're going to, if you're looking to add a dive watch to your collection for under a hundred or under $200, I feel like this has to be in the conversation. Yeah, I don't disagree.</td>

<td>It's a, it's a great, I mean, it's right there in sort of the, everybody needs to know about this watch if they're making an entry level decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah.  So that's what I went with. Those are my three, the Orient second generation Bambino V1, the Seagull 1963 Chrono, and the Citizen EcoDrive ProMaster Diver.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So you have twice as many mechanical movements in your collection than I do.</td>

<td>Yeah, right? Who saw that coming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But you still have an EcoDrive. No, I actually, I really like your choices. I think they're I think you'd be hard-pressed to go wrong with any of them. I'm not sure I love this Citizen Diver. I actually tried this on at a Fred Meyer, which is a grocery department store that we have here. But I was not blown away by the case finishing on it. Really? I wasn't. Which is maybe me being a little snobby. And I think I didn't want to like it either because I don't love the eco-drive movement.  But for 163 bucks, shit, it's solar powered, 200 meters. Um, I think that you're gonna, you're, you're gonna just love that watch forever if you pick it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So good, good choices. Yeah. I'm, I think we, I'm surprised we didn't have any overlap. I think we came together with a pretty eclectic list of watches. I like you going with a boutique watch and with a, I've heard of Skirfa before, um, and not really done a whole lot of looking into them, but I think, I'm interested that we went the routes that we went. I went like a very predictable route away from courts. I had an eco drive. I just, I don't know. Citizen was my way in. Eco drive was my way in. So I feel like that, I feel like eco drive should be in the conversation of any beginning your watch collection conversation. Make all the faces you want, man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I don't know. I mean, I actually don't have anything against eco drive.  The technology is really good. I don't know why it's just never. I think I associate EcoDrive with Macy's. You buy Rolex at Macy's. Well, yeah, I guess. Can you? Can you? I mean, is there even Macy's anymore? Do they shut them all down or there's still a few of them? I know they shut the one in Portland down.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I tried on an SKX at a Macy's recently. It's been in the last year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, yeah, so I actually had, uh, I know we both had some, some honorable mentions, some alibis that we wanted to throw in. Um, and, and I'll say this decision was actually a little tough for me. I was as late as today, 10 minutes before we started kind of on the fence on a couple of these. Um, the Bernhardt.  That Benico Anchor, I think is a fantastic watch. I'm not really an homage guy. This is an homage for sure. I mean, I'm not sure it's not even a straight rip off of the Explorer. The font is exactly the same. It's a little bit bigger, I think, not a lot bigger, but this is an homage for sure. This is so much an homage that if someone didn't know what they were looking at, they might think it was an Explorer if they knew what to look for. So obviously Submariner homages are a dime a dozen. As are Submariners. Explorer in and of itself is a little bit more obscure. Certainly Explorer homages are more obscure. That makes me feel a little bit better. But the Explorer homage, you know, it is what it is. I also don't really love the hooded lugs on this. So, when I first started looking, the Hamilton Khaki King popped up in my search. Now, this is not a cheap watch. No. At $375 on a bracelet, this watch takes up dang near two-thirds of the budget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I'd be interested to build that as the foundation and see what you come up with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, and so that is where I started. I picked this watch and I thought, you know, that's it. It's 40 millimeters.  Uh, which should come as no surprise. It's got that fantastic military field watch case with the, those crown guards that, you know, the curve into the crown guards. Um, I love that case style. I love the day complication that, that runs at, uh, across the 12 o'clock. Uh, just a super beautiful watch, polished bezel on it, you know, reflects the light.  Um, I love it. I like that bracelet. 375 bucks though, kind of throws things a little out of whack. Uh, when I, when I first came up with this collection, I started here, I made it to the SSB and then I had, you know, like a hundred bucks to pick a diaper, which is, which is quite a bit of money still. Manageable, but hard. And that left me with another watch that is probably super underrated, but everybody will know the Casio Duro, uh, MDV 106 dive watch. This thing at 42 bucks is an absolutely incredible value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I expected you to go that route. I figured I'd see one like the, like the Hamilton, a $150 watch, and then like a, Iron Man. It's a beater. Just, just like a, you can do whatever you want to this watch and you're not gonna care. Just something that, cause you need to get a third watch in there and you have $62.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>When I think this does that actually, um, you know, for, for 45 bucks, mineral glass on the crystal, that's, that's kind of want, want, um, pretty crappy loom on the maxi dial, which is what, what, but For 45 bucks or 42 bucks, you're going to be able to bang this in anything you want to. 200 meter water resistance, screw-down crown, screw-down crown. This is cool. I'm surprised that I don't own one. I kind of am too. Anyway, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Why don't we have this watch? And in the photo, it looks nice. It looks like the kind of watch that could pass for Something that doesn't cost 42 bucks. I'd be interested to see it in person to flesh that out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But once I've tried these on before, I've tried, I think I tried one on the Walmart ones actually, believe it or not, it sounds like, Oh, that's the girl. Uh, I really liked that Marlon logo. Obviously it does not have any sort of frills to it. You know, I'm, I'm wearing my AMW 320 Casio today, which is a watch I really love. I think it's about the same size, 44 millimeters.  Um, probably very similar finishing. And I love, I love this watch. This is that kindergarten cop, kindergarten cop watch. Um, you know, it's a totally, uh, totally respectable watch as far as I'm concerned, different than this, than the Durrell, but I really liked this watch. It gets play. I mean, it gets pretty regular where my collection, I bought this Dakota, uh, tropic strap specifically for this watch. Cause I wanted to have a strap that I really liked for it. Um, yeah, I feel like they fit really similar, um, places in a collection. So those didn't make the list. Ultimately I dropped them off and I went with a more balanced list, but this, this was very close. You know, the, the more expensive Hamilton khaki King, what I don't like about the Hamilton khaki King, it's a $375 field watch.  with 50 meters of water resistant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>When is the last time you were more than a meter underwater?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, but you know, it's not how far underwater you go. And I swim actually pretty frequently. It's not, you know, 50 meters means you can go down 50 meters. It doesn't have any screw down crown. It is, and there's a lot of reviews on these online if people say, I was just wearing it like normal and it fogged up and got water inside.  that to me is a major problem. If I can't wear a watch and do all the everyday things, you know, I want to be able to wear a watch in the shower and not worry about it because I'm, I'm absent minded, especially at six 30 in the morning. I'm going to, I'm going to forget. Um, you know, if I'm wearing the, the 1963 I better don't, right. Don't screw it up. So, um, but yeah, so those two didn't make the list. What about you? I know you had some honorable mentions.</td>

Now that we're onto this whole new subject, it wouldn't have replaced the seagull. The seagull was kind of the, That was the big ticket that was in my on my list. So I worked around that. Just being that it's hard to find a chronograph like that. And I really like that style.

Such a great, not even Russian, Soviet history behind it. They look cool. They run great. The only thing that I don't like about it is that there's no way to quickly adjust the date. So if I let it run on a battery and it's the first of the month and the date is set on the 8th, it's not getting worn. And because of that, it spends a lot more time in the box than it does on my wrist. But if I decide to pull it out on a day where I'm either behind on the watch, I'm like two or three days behind, or I'm on it, that's called winning the lottery. And that thing goes on, and I'll wear it for four, five, six days because the date stays up. The date's already good, so I'm not gonna mess around with fighting the date.</td>

I suppose they're probably a less durable coating than a PVD or DLC coating. So it's going to, you're going to bang it and the soft aluminum is going to scratch. I think these things are going to patina it really well. And they're 20 bucks cheaper. 120 bucks. Cool watch. And a little bit smaller too, I think.</td>

<td>Yeah, the 40 as opposed to 42.  So, um, but yeah, the anodized is a cool look. There's a couple of watches out there that marathon pilots watch that has the anodized, uh, has the anodized coating on it. Another watch that I've, um, looked at lustfully, I think is an okay adjective for how I've looked at those watches.</td>

<td>So I think we're at that part of the show where we talk about other things we like, not watch things, other things we like.  I know you said you had a couple things. What came up in your internet ramblings this week?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So a couple things. One of the first things is I spend probably more time than I should. You know, I might be painting a bad picture of myself. I don't spend as much, I don't waste as much time on the internet as I may seem like.  Or maybe I do. I don't know. If I'm having to defend myself, I feel like maybe there is a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>What do you got here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Anyway, so judge you for your internet. First thing, all things interesting. Are you familiar? What is it? All things interesting. I'm not familiar. It's a website. It's a, it's a website about all things interesting. I spend some time on there, not a whole lot, but it's a good like show up. They've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So wait, quick question. Yes. Is it all of the interesting things or is it, or is it all things on the website are interesting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Maybe it's both. All right. Does it have to be either? Carry on. Anyway, it's got news, science, history, and the whole thing is news stories, history stories, science stories you may or may not have heard about. First thing that I saw may two or three days ago or might have been yesterday in the recent past was the way that NASA went ahead and fixed the Hubble telescope. And they fixed it much like you or I would fix our cable.  They very seriously. So there's a whole long story and they turned this gyroscope off, uh, and they were using a different one and they went to go back to use this other gyroscope. And when they powered it on, there were some errors in it. So they went through what they called their reboot. And I'm using air quotes because I think it's important that NASA just called it their reboot, uh, system for it, function for it. When in reality, they just turned it off.  and turned it back on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That's what I do with my TV or phone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Exactly. And as I was, as I was talking to my coworkers about it today, and my first thought was, it certainly wasn't a NASA scientist who was like, Oh yeah, this is what we need to do. It was some like janitor or intern who was in there. It was like, have you, have you tried turning it off and turning it back on? It works for my cable all the time. And I'm just imagining NASA like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Is that a real part of the story?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's what I'm, that's what I'm imagining in my head.  Because they didn't really go into detail as to whose idea it was. So I'm going to take some, some artistic license here and imagine it was just some dude in there in this room. Pushing the bucket with the mop. Oh yeah. Yeah. By the mop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Did you try turning it off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So that's what NASA did to reboot this very expensive system in the Hubble telescope. Next. This is something that I was very excited to learn about a couple months ago and it just came back into my consciousness as we're in the middle of football season, I started thinking about what I want to do for the Super Bowl this year. And the Super Bowl for me is always a little bit stressful because I always, if people come to my house, I have to clean, I have to cook, like I have to have a whole bunch of, you have to have Super Bowl stuff there. And it's hard to please everyone.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Like those grape jelly meatballs? Yeah. That's my jam. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Or little hot dogs. Or little smokies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Little smokies, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I want to do a little better than that. So I usually go overboard and spend all of Friday and Saturday smoking, leaving in the kitchen over the smoker. I very seriously smell like campfire, but this year I found the solution and I'm going to go with it. Did you know, are you familiar with cat's deli in New York?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Uh, yes, I, I'm familiar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Okay. So, uh, in the, in 2016 Zagat ranked them as the best deli in New York and they're widely regarded as one of the best delis in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, it comes up in best deli conversations. Always, yeah, always. Not that we have a lot of best delis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>No, not here, but we have to just read about them because we certainly don't have them here. They do free domestic shipping. So for 175 money, right? I wrote it down. Yeah, for 175 money, you can get what they call their game day package, which is a pound of corned beef, two pounds of pastrami, a loaf of rye bread, a pound of mustard. I didn't realize that mustard came in like weight increments. I usually thought it was volume. What does a pound of mustard look like? I don't know. I don't know, but I'm going to buy it so you'll get to see it because you'll certainly get to enjoy some of this. A pound of Russian dressing. Again, something I would think would come in volume, not weight. A pound of Swiss cheese.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Do you think it comes in a bag? I hope it comes in a bag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I hope it does. And whenever you buy one of these things, you get a hat or a shirt.  Included. Which, I mean, for 175 bucks, I better be getting a hat or a shirt. You also get a small soft salami, a dozen pigs in a blanket, and a quart of either their, uh, their, either their pickles. They have, like, a semi-sour and a... Oh, shoot. I wish I could remember the other one. They have two varieties of pickles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So, four pounds of cured meat, a t-shirt, a whole shitload of sauce.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Two pounds of it. Some sausage or salami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Uh, yeah. A small soft salami, a dozen pigs in a blanket, and a quart of pickles.  Now, to put this in perspective, it costs $22.75 for a sandwich at Cat's Deli currently. You walk through the door, you're paying $22.75 for a sandwich. And I can tell you, having been there, it is the best sandwich I've ever had. I was in New York, I don't know, five years ago or so, and the sandwich wasn't $22 at the time. It was probably like $16. And what's more miraculous about the fact that there wasn't a line.  I just, I walked in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Because it's a $22 sandwich.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>No, it's always a line. Every picture you see at Cat's Deli, it's a line around the block. I had a friend who lived in New York. He was like, Hey, you have to go to Cat's Deli. Okay, whatever. I'll go to Cat's Deli. You're the, you're the boss. Like you, you live here. I'm just visiting. We walked right in, right up to the counter. I texted him. I was like, what's the big deal? And he said it was impossible. Like there's just no way I could just hit this perfect window where there's no line. We walk in, we get our sandwich. It's hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. And it's,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Did you get a corned beef or Reuben or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I guess I got a pastrami sandwich with a little bit of their mustard on it. The only thing that I could even begin to complain about is that the bread was not thick enough to support the fact that I got very seriously a pound of meat between these two slices of bread. I ate the whole thing, both my pickles. I had meat sweats for two days following it. My wife ate half of the sandwich and thought she was going to die. She doesn't handle meat sweats well. I'm a trash monster.  I think we talked about being a trash monster last week. That's going to be a recurring theme, is that I'm just a trash monster. I ate the whole thing, thought I was going to die. She ate half of it, could have died because she doesn't handle that kind of trauma to her insides the way that I do.</td>

Yeah, yeah.  Four. We came, we got to four. Kim listened to. Nice. Sam didn't listen. She probably won't listen to this one. So if you do listen, blueberry, that'll be the code word. Uh, anyway, anyway, for 175 bucks you get.</td>

<td>I don't know, man. It's gotta be fast. So in World War II, their tagline that they created was, send a salami to your boy in the army. They still use that. I still see on my Instagram feed, send a salami to your boy in the army. So I don't know how they ship it. It's gotta, I mean, Hello Fresh does it.  And they do it with raw ingredients. So I'm imagining you're going to get it in like a cardboard box that's insulated. You probably have to heat it up in the oven or something.</td>

<td>And you're doing it.  yeah i get to have it at my house review of the cats will come in a package mid-february coming soon all right other things i like amazingly i found an article about a nasa telescope that had to be repaired so my article was on box.com an article about the kepler space telescope which is weird uh the telescope that Rest in peace was decommissioned this week. Last week. After, uh, I think nine years or seven years, eight years, nine years, something like that. 2,600 exoplanets discovered by the Kepler telescope when it was launched in 2009. Only. So that's nine years that it's been in commission. Fuck. Only 900 off 900 exoplanets had been discovered.  It discovered 2600 exoplanets. So an exoplanet, uh, I learned from this article is a planet that is outside orbiting a star outside of our solar system, orbiting a star. That's not the sun in other words. So they put it out, they put it out of commission this week, but it actually lived a lot longer than it was supposed to. It shut down a number of years ago. Uh, did they just turn it back on? You know, they did not.  And I don't know how this works, because this sounds like bullshit science to me. I'm sure it's real. Supposedly they used solar rays to change the flight course of Kepler so that they could continue to view planets. It shut down. It had some sort of critical malfunction. They used the pressure of solar rays to reset this thing. Even though it was off and they couldn't...  90% of the people listening to this will be smarter than me. Read the article. Vox.com. Okay. I'm reading it. Kepler Space Telescope. Fantastic. The second thing I found, I was going to stop here. I was only, I only had two things. I've got three now.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Do it.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But second thing. If they're still listening, they're still listening, right? Beastie Boys, Mike Diamond, Adam Horowitz have released a autobiography, a Beastie Boys autobiography called the Beastie Boys book.  I haven't gotten it yet, but I need to. It's not a lot of money. It's like $36, $32, something like that. Contributions by Amy Poehler, Spike Jonze, Wes Anderson. Obviously a ton of pictures. Adam Yauch died several years ago, which was, I think, probably the first time a celebrity has died that I felt gutted. I heard that Adam Yauch had died of cancer.  affected me, you know, cause I grew up, I'm a little bit older than you, not much. Grew up with Beastie Boys. They were a part of my youthful consciousness. Very much so. And so I'm excited about the book. I haven't bought it yet. It's on the radar. I'll buy it. I'll give a review. Looks fantastic. The third thing I have, and this just came up today, Radio Lab. I know you've listened to Radio Lab. Radio Lab is probably one of the most popular podcasts out there.  Um, I think they get millions and millions of listens every week, but besides ours, this is number two. Yeah. Yeah. I saw that. I saw the reviews this week's episode on radio lab is about the famous, uh, Wells Orson Wells, uh, space tech, where the world's Oh, really broadcast. And, um, it's fascinating. So I've been listening to this over the last couple of days. Uh, and, the way the way Radiolab presents everything is so compelling and so interesting and so it could be that they're giving me fairly benign information and it's just so interesting. You don't know anything about it. Which is what happens every time you listen to Radiolab they have the you know I don't know if you've listened to their episode about the shrimp the the mantis shrimp that can punch real fast and see in a billion colors you know it's a stupid Animal, uh, I want to know more about that shrimp just having you mentioned so I'm gonna download that episode So there were the world's podcast. It's this week's episode. It's been fantastic so far the thing I thought is interesting is there was a professor who was talking about it and he seemed to be of the opinion that the mass hysteria Sentiment that we all know were the world's caused is a myth Interesting that it's a myth that almost nobody listened to it And that the people that did listen to it knew it was fake. And that there was a newspaper reaction to try to get the radio shut down because the newspapers were losing business to the radio at the time. And so the newspapers were like, see, look at these radio people. I'm paraphrasing, obviously. Listen to yourself. It's fascinating, super interesting. Take a look. And that's that's the other things I have.  three instead of two as planned well i'm out of things too this was fun this was fun so here's the deal guys we are learning how to do this as we go we're not good at it we're not good at it we bump the table we bump the microphone we are realizing that it's harder to breathe when you're on microphone than you otherwise think my nose feels stuffy uh i'm out of breath it's a weird thing this is hard we're editing for the first time trying to figure it out Stick with us. Any sort of advice. If you do listen, you have any sort of advice, we'd love to have it. We'd love to have you. We're going to keep making podcasts every week. So like it or not, you're going to see our new podcast every week. Listen or don't, we're still going to do it. Every Thursday. So thanks for joining us for this second episode of 40 in 20, which still doesn't have a name. It will be named by the time you hear it. Don't forget to tune back in next Thursday for another hour of watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like. Thanks for listening. Bye.
