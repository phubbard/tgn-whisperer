<td>Hello, fellow watch lovers, nerds, enthusiasts, or however you identify. You're listening to 40 and 20, The Watch Book, a podcast with your host, Andrew and my good friend Everett. Here, we talk about watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like. Daddy, how are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Daddy's here. I'm back. Not solo this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Not solo. I have to say, I tried to talk you out of doing that because I could not imagine doing even a five minute monologue to share with the people by myself and you killed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Going into it, I was like, this is going to be 10 minutes long and everyone's going to be like, why they even bother? I was surprised that I was able to talk that long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You went like 45 minutes, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>A little under 40, I think like 37 or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, it was awesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It was well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And we needed it because we were both in a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's right. Yeah.  We were sick. We were sick. Um, well in any event, welcome back. Glad to have you back on the board. Glad to have you back on the show with when we're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's nice to have everyone together. We don't get together often enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>The gang's all back together. We've actually never met Will in person, any of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>He does it on purpose, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. He, uh, you know, we met Will recording an episode of this podcast and at the time, At the time, none of us really anticipated that we were going to have a website together and a show and that three years later we'd have this happy marriage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It works for me though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah, it works for me. Is it okay if you ask me how I'm doing? Everett, how are you? I'm fine. I'm a little, you know, as usual, I'm a little grumpy that you've You've chosen Will to be your good friend, but that's okay. No, I'm great. Everything's sort of back to normal, meaning I'm super behind at work and don't have time to do anything at all. So, but I'm doing really well. Andrew, how are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I'm super good. The World Athletic Championships are in town currently. So with that, it means that there's big crowds. There's a lot of excitement. And through Sam's work, I got to go to a session of the World Athletic Championships. So last night I got to go see women's discus, the women's triple jump finals, the men's 3000 steeplechase final.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That was a good race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>That was a great race. Uh, men's high jump finals, women's 3000 finals, and one of the tathalons. Hep tathalon. Was it the hep finish last night? Yeah. So they, I got to watch the 800 meter final race.  And it was so cool. Yeah. I'm like, I'm, I've never been anti or pro track and field events. They, I've just been always perfectly medium. This is the first large scale event that I've ever been to. It's first time I've been to Hayward since the renovations been done. It was awesome. I loved every second of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It's, it's a totally different thing. Uh, actually you guys at home don't know this, but Will, Editor-in-chief Daddy Will is actually a huge track and field fan. He never shuts up about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>I was going to say, I actually got to watch my kids run around the house for an hour straight. So it's pretty much the same thing. Pretty much the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And I'm sure they covered more than 3000 meters and it's far more, there's a lot more obstacles in your residence than a steeplechase. It's like a Spartan race.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>I was throwing obstacles at them and making it more fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's a tough mudder if you include the backyard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Well, gentlemen, we're here. We've got a mission tonight. We're here. We're going to talk. We're here to talk about watches as per usual, as per the usual. This is actually a topic. I believe this is a topic of Will's creation. This is a Will proposal. So we're obligated to do it. We actually hated the fucking idea, but here we are because Will is the boss. Sometimes you do things when your boss tells you to do it. That's right. You just do them. You say, okay,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>We got it. And you don't complain about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>We understand the assignment. We won't complain. Here we are. But what we've done here, well, actually, why don't you, Will? You can do the honors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. So we're going to talk about watches, but we're going to talk about some watches because there are stipulations to this topic. So everybody goes on about a one watch collection, two watch collection, et cetera, et cetera. So we decided to go with a two watch collection, but Why not just make it a boring two-watch collection? Let's make it a little interesting. So what we did is you can have two watches up to $10,000 each. So $20,000 total, but you can't exceed $10,000 for one watch. And it cannot be an Omega, a Seiko, a Rolex, or their main subsidiaries, which would be Tudor and Grand Seiko. So taking all the super popular stuff off the table to keep us a little more creative.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Wait, we can't do Tudor or Grand Seiko?  Nope. I need a minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Too bad, Andrew. Back to the drawing board.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. And I think this is a different exercise than I've ever really, I mean, this is beyond any sort of two or three watch Andrew and I have ever done. I mean, this is really, at this level, you start to get into, you know, dream watches perhaps a little bit at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But also not, this is in the five to $15,000 price range is really interesting. Yeah. Because there's, there's a lot, but like the, for me at least like the real dream watches, the super unobtainium, those start above like $15,000. There's, there's a bit of a, I think a gap when you start thinking like you have your, your normal tier luxury watches in the, in the five to $15,000 range.  But then you've got your next level shit and they've got some stuff in like eight to 10. But a lot of that next level shit really starts in like the 16, 18 zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I was finding a lot of stuff that I was kind of interested in at the 10 to 12 range, certainly retail. Um, yeah, that to get under 10, it was a little tricky. So we did have, we did stipulate that we're talking street value. So if you can find a retailer that will sell it, um, that, that place. So, Some of these watches may regularly be more expensive if you buy them from the manufacturer or if you buy them from, you know, at a boutique or a gallery, they may be more expensive. But the stipulation was you have to be able to get these for under 10 grand. So.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>And it and it has to be actually available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>So not a not a discontinued watch. Right. That's right. So current be able to be able to buy it new at somewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Not just like new inbox occasionally on eBay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Right. Well, yeah. And I, I went, I think we talked about this when I was looking at it. I didn't look up what watches can I get for 10 is I just picked my watches and saw if they fit into that category. And I was, I was happy to say that, uh, I'll talk about the one, the first one that I picked and had to actually go down a little bit because I stayed in the family.  but I had to remove a complication to stay in the budget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>We'll land it. Let's start. So we're going to do, usually we go round table and we do like our draft picks. But for this exercise, we all agreed that it made more sense for each of us to talk about our pairing of watches. So, Will, let's hear it. What you got?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>All right. So I'm going to say what I started with.  and then what complication I had to remove, but I'm happy with what I landed on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You removed a complication, I like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I have about nine watches I'm gonna discuss, so talk about what you need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Keep your damn small seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>So I was gonna go with the Polaris Chronograph, but that was a little expensive, so down... I don't know if I wanna call it a downgrade. I went down, removed the complication, to the Polaris Automatic, which is the three-hander that's got the dual crowns. So it's internal rotating bezel, compressor style, whatever you want to call it. And I went with the blue dial. So that's reference number for the people who want to look it up. Q9008180. It's that rad electric blue too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love it. I tried on the black one, man, four or five years ago and just absolutely loved it. And if money was no object, I would go out and buy that chronograph today. Um, but I still love the, the three hand automatic. I think it's such a cool, I don't know if you'd call it a dive watch. I mean, it is, I think it's only got a hundred meters of water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's not, not whatever, but it's not is. Yeah. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. But it's, it, it's a very good sport watch. Um, that I think you could probably put with just about anything and look cool doing it. And it'll, it'll pair well with what my second pick is to fit into the, we can get in to any occasion type thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Well, before you move on, let's talk a little bit about the JLC. Cause I think actually this watch kind of puts a point on what you can get at $10,000, right? So first we've got, we've got Jaeger LeCoultre, which is You know, this is they're a player, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>This is here's the problem, though, at ten thousand, you're not getting it on a bracelet. Yours is yours is what? Ninety two. No bracelet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>It is. It is eighty two dollars on the bracelet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Eighty two on a bracelet. All right. Yes, sir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And you're getting you're getting pedigree like haute horology pedigree. You're this watch is not maybe haute horology, but that's, you know,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>But it's within the family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>It's close. Yeah. It's close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. You're getting a killer movement. Which movement does this watch have in it? You have to remind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>This was briefly on my list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It was on my list too. They don't have the name of their movement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Oh, the 898. They just go automatic winding components 195.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>JLC caliber 898. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah, there we go. And it's a good looking movement too. It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>in-house, super sexy, semi-skeletonized, sort of see-through rotor, hand finishing, full deal deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's a cool cutout in the rotor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. I like that also, they keep it pretty thin. It's about 11 millimeters. And even with the exhibition case back, it's not a 13 millimeter watch. And it's 41 millimeters wide for those who don't know. I mean, that's Perfect for every day. Um, you know, it's going to, I think it's going to carry some significant risk presence at 41 because it's a lot of dial because of that internal bezel. But those numerals, they're so good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. I really like, I really like the, so this is the one with the memo box logo at the top, right? No, this has the JLC logo, Craig, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. This is, this is the no date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Will doesn't like dates.  Yeah, he's anti.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Dates or no dates, I can take it or leave it on just about any watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Doesn't bother me either way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>This is the 8180 reference?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Oh, they asked me for their feedback, for my feedback on their website experience. Thanks, JLC. 11.2 thickness, though, even at 41, this is going to have wrist presence, but it's still going to be really sleek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yep.  It's going to slip under the cuff. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So what are you going to wear to top your cuff? What are you going to, where are you going to pair this with Will?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>All right. So I was originally going to go with the black dial Polaris, but then I was like, nah, based on my second pick, I was like, I need to go blue. Got to have some, some color. And you guys know about blue dials, right? We do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You like blue. It's pretty okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. It's blue. So for my second pick, um, I can't, I can't live life without a chronograph. So I'm going with the, Zenith Chronomaster Original on the bracelet. So get ready for the reference number. Here it comes. 03.3200.3600.21.M3200. So this is the El Primero Original, or sorry, Chronomaster Original with the El Primero movement. It's the black dial that has the tannish lume on it, which You guys know me. I'm not I'm not a big. Aged loom fan, but for whatever reason, I feel like it works with this watch. I'm not sure if it's the like the fonts and everything that they chose, but the whole thing just looks like someone lifted a watch from the 70s and made it brand new today with age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I think it's because the age loom is really subtle. It's it's just gently aged. It's not like the brown nonsense age loom.  It's also pretty small loom plots. And this is also a watch that was on my, on and off my list over the last couple of weeks planning for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. Yeah. And it, I think that's what it is, is that the loom plots are pretty small and the three and the nine and the six are not there at all. So, um, you know, they're not there, but the best thing about this watch is that it's 38 millimeters. So, I mean, for a chronograph with that movement, at 38 millimeters, and it is, I think it's like 13 thick. And that includes the crystal, I think. So that's pretty solid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>And it's got that cool El Primero movement where the chronograph hand ticks, what is it, 10 times a second, I think. I don't remember off the top of my head. And then it's got the high beat movement for the The main timekeeping. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It's just a great watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>This, this watch was, this watch was on and off my list and what removed it from my list was the 50 meters of water resistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. That's the only killer. When I was feeling, that's why I went with the JLC. I got my water watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. But that was when I was filling this void, the void that I was looking to fill, I needed more water resistance than this.  So let's talk about the pairing. We've got the JLC automatic, should be a chronograph, but isn't, which you rectified with the Zenith El Primero, which is not the El Primero, it's the Chronomaster, but it's the El Primero movement. Let's talk about the pairing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>The real pairing here is that the Polaris has polished outside links on the bracelet and the Zenith has polished center links. So that's That's really what it's all about right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Perfect compliment. If I could take one bracelet and put it on the other, it's like it's a perfect watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah, exactly. They might fit. You never know. I would certainly try if I own both these watches just to see what happens. I don't think the finishing would match, but I think it's hard to go wrong with these two watches at you know any budget i think even if you're shooting higher if you said twenty thousand dollars per watch i might still land on these two watches uh... just as i've always love that i've loved the polaris family in general but uh... i didn't know about the chronograph for a while i was thought it was just automatic with the one they call automatic for the longest time so it was my first love of the polaris family uh... and uh... i mean the zenith If you want all the cool stuff about watches, history, the movement that's inside it, you know, look, style, everything. I mean, that's got it. And I really love chronographs. And if I wasn't going to have my Speedmaster, which, you know, we excluded from this list, this would definitely be it. I don't think I mentioned the price on it, but it's 9,500. So right at the top there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Brand new from the website, too. So that's you can get that boutique experience for under 10 grand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>This is arguably the coolest chronograph in existence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Well, yeah, I mean, in terms of in terms of automatic chronographs, it was along with Seiko right there at the beginning, right there at the beginning, has continued to improve it without getting weird at the</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I like what you've done with brands here.</td>

I'm not sure we've said this yet, but, but one of the concepts here that was floated is these are like the exit watches, right? You're going to, you're going to dump the collection.  You got 10,000 per watch, go get two watches today. And this is what you're stuck with. And I think in that context, this, these are great watches, right? You're going to, you're going to be able to do everything you need to do. Um, size on both of these is great. Uh, brands are great. And you're going to qualities.</td>

<td>So here's my notes on this watch. Iconic movement, right? We've already kind of been over this, but this is a totally, absolutely high quality, iconic movement, 36,000 beats per minute. It's also a completely modern sport chronograph. And I say that not in compared to any other major players, but this is a watch that was released just a couple of years ago.  all the finishing, all of the design. This is an evolution of one of the greatest chronographs of all time in a completely modern package. 10 atmospheres of water resistance, great size, 41 millimeter case. Zenith DNA throughout, right? This watch is 100% a by-product of Zenith's watchmaking chops.  There were some accusations when this came out that this was kind of a Daytona clone. And I think from a top-down view, you can understand why people say that. I think it's a fair comparison to make. With that said, if you get an opportunity to see this watch in person, or if you can even just play with it, you can see that really, once you get past that top-down, once you get any sort of angle on the case sides, or you look at it from the bottom for sure, you can see that this watch is pure Zenith DNA. The case profile in this thing does not look anything like a Rolex.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>No, but it's a three subdial chronograph, which means it's a Daytona ripoff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Well, yeah. I mean, I think the comparisons are more astute than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>However... They are, but at large, how many three subdial configurations can you really come up with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So I love the date window on this. Yes. I love the tricolor registers. I love the exhibition case back with that beautiful, beautiful movement showing off. Um, yep. And, and I really love everything about it. I will say I don't love the clasp. I like the bracelet. The clasp is clearly a Rolex knockoff.  Like, it's just undeniable that it's a Rolex knockoff. That kind of bugs me. It's like, here's the NF, do your own clasp. We'll love it. Just make it not look like a, you know, whatever the Rolex, what's the word I'm looking for? Their modern dive clasp. Glide lock. Glide lock. They've done a glide lock here. And that's disappointing to me. But other than that, I just think for 10,000 bucks, if you can find this thing for 10,000 bucks, and you can right now on World of Luxury, do it.</td>

<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Dude, I mean, this is... Why can't I find a picture of this clasp?</td>

<td>You know, I don't know. I've seen a few reviews of this and the clasp... I mean, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's a Rolex clasp at a distance. It is one-to-one, which is, you know, for a company like Zenith, I think that's problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Yeah, they could do better. They should do better.</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>Yeah. It's cause it's tied to the original. It's yeah. It's kind of, I think it's a little bit closer to like the original Chrono Master, which that's fine, but I just like how it's, I don't know. I like how it's cutting off part of the dial in a way. It doesn't feel like it's floating as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It feels more deliberate when it cuts into the, to that chapter ring there. It, the, the one on the, uh, on the sport on Everett's pick is wholly independent of that.  And it feels it feels like it's floating. I think that was a good description. I think it's cool. I think it's more 70s. It just has that that cool like we're going to throw this here. And because it's here, we need to create some space for it. And they cut into the minute track.</td>

<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Yeah. Oh, I found the clasp. Yeah, that is definitely Rolex looking.  It does not have glide lock though. I see micro adjust holes on the side.</td>

You can get a dope best-in-class, super historically significant, top-of-the-line modern chronograph from a classic horology company today.</td>

<td>It's North of Omega and Tudor and Rolex. It's North of there, but it's still in the, in the realm of they're, they're in, in the door is a little bit North of your MSRP in the door of, of these other brands. But truly what you're paying is right in the neighborhood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. You know, with a company like Zenith, you're still getting sort of mass production type of, of, production. So you're not getting anything truly hand finished. You might get some hand finishing on this movement. I'm not a hundred percent on that, but you're, you're still getting a mass produced watch, which I think it's, it's a little, uh, at some point you have to, um, you know, make a decision. Like if you're going to be spending, uh, a small fortune on a watch, what is it? What are the things you actually want? So, This is a weird space, kind of like you were talking about earlier, Andrew. It's a little bit of an awkward place to buy a watch. It's not enough money to get hand finishing, anything truly haute, but it is right there where you're going to get top of the line, mass-produced watch technology.</td>

<td>I picked for my second watch. So I really wanted something dressy for my second watch. I'm a huge fan of, as you guys know, the Chopard Alpine Eagle.  but I couldn't get it in the budget. I couldn't get it in the budget. So I found what I think, what I thought at the time I picked it was the next best thing. And as I've explored this watch, it may actually be stealing personal Everett market share from the Alpine Eagle. This is the Piaget Polo S. So Piaget has made a watch since the, so Piaget obviously famous jewelry company, also got some watch shops. They have, Piaget, since the late 70s, been making a sport watch called the Polo. This watch was designed by the company namesake, and it was, if you look at the original 70s and 80s Polos, this is very much of the time. The Polo S came out, I think, in 2016.  And when it came out, you're correct. When it came out, there was a little bit of sort of general grumbling, you know, okay, this is a Nautilus look like, um, you know, just some grumbling. I will say, if you go back and look at Piaget's catalog, they're drawing on a, the lineage of the Piaget or the, of the Polo, but also some of the other watches in their collection, in particular the Imperator, With that said, it's undeniable that there was an aesthetic that they were after with this, and that aesthetic was the Nautilus. You'd be a fool to try to deny it, and I can't imagine even Piaget would deny it. What you get, however, for a street value, I could find $9,000, $8,895 for this, is a really, really, really gorgeous case. Piaget, typically a precious metal company. I think currently this is their only steel watch. So the finishing is just, even from a distance, stunning. You're getting a great size. I think these are 41 millimeters or 42 millimeters, but 9.4 thick. So you're getting kind of a big watch, short lug to lug, 36 and a half lug to lug and 9.4 millimeters of thickness. This watch is going to wear like a super premium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And you got 36. I mean, it's going to wear super small.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's right. They, they not using an in-house movement for this. They call it, I think, uh, a manufacturer caliber, but actually what it is is a Cartier movement, the MC 1904 movement, which is, a chronometer capable movement, edikron, uh, edikron adjustment, um, just super high end chronometer grid balance that can be adjusted by, you know, any watchmaker to be in cost spec, uh, and, and, and the movement's been finished. So they've taken this Cartier movement and finished it beyond anything that Cartier does with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Um, 100 meters of water resistance. So a true sport dress, sport watch, um, great dimensions and the, and the bracelet is really stunning. I'll say there's one thing I don't like about the bracelet, which is there's no taper.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>No, you don't. I was going to think it was a butterfly clasp and I don't like the butterfly clasp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So you've got a 21 millimeter to 21 millimeter bracelet, which I think is going to be a little awkward. Um, and a butterfly class. However, the, finishing on the bracelet and the clasp from what I can see is better than anything else under $10,000. This is a truly high end, uh, Piaget being really a jewelry maker. This is a jewelry grade piece of, of horology with a really dope spec on it. I love it. I think for nine grand, if you can find this thing for nine grand.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You can get it on jumbo shop right now for nine grand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Link in the show notes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Uh, man, I love it.  The Englage on the on like the 130 of the bezel is dope. It almost creates like a heart shaped bezel without being heart shaped. It's still very square, very Nautilus square. But the angles that they create with the beveling across that bezel is dope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Kind of a TV dial. Yeah. True to Piaget's historical catalog. As much as this watch is clearly meant to capture some of that Nautilus market share, I think Piaget has done a really good job. And also just this is our watch. Yeah, it kind of looks like that watch, but this is actually our watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So this watch is something I came across and moved on from because their website has it at about 12 grand. Right. And I didn't think to find watches that I liked and bargain hunt for them.  Which is kind of your M.O. Whenever we do these prices, you're like, all right, I found this on eBay. There's three of them, which means you can get them on eBay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Will</td>
<td>I would be very curious to put the finishing of this up against the JLC that I picked, because when I was doing some research on the Polaris, everyone talks about the case finishing on it. Yeah. How just bonkers good it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I think that that's both of these companies games. I was really, I was really happy to see that you went with the JLC because I was looking at that same watch for the same reasons. Everybody says, Hey, look, you're going to get this and just be blown away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Oh, I think that's unique to, I mean, JLC does a really uniquely good job as a watch company finishing watches, but Piaget and Cartier both make sense. Piaget and Cartier are both jewelry companies who also happen to make watches. And because of that, their finishing is</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Fucking phenomenal. I think you see that comparison a lot. Piaget, Cartier, and also Chopard gets dumped into there too. Yeah.</td>

This watch does similar things. Um, And I just, I need to try it on. I think I won't like the bracelet. And I'll tell you, if I could have found it, if I could have found an Alpine Eagle under $10,000, that would have been my choice here. But I'm really, really enamored by this watch.</td>

<td>This is a good segue for mine. Let's do it. So my first pick.  is home watches, women's watches on the Cartier website, because the Cartier Santos medium is on their website as a women's watch. It's perfectly sized. I think we've all, Will, you've had a medium on your wrist before, right?</td>

<td>Uh, I don't remember what size it was. I'm pretty sure it was a medium.</td>

<td>The Santos medium is perfect. I know you've worn one cause we've worn it at the same time.  So it's the Santos de Cartier watch. It's the medium size. The Santos watch medium model. First ever wrist watch. Yes. First ever wrist watch. First pilot's watch. It is insane to me that this is only 6,800 bucks. That this watch hasn't been able to keep Cartier prices way north of that just with the urology chops but this is my first pick and and it's my first pick for a lot of reasons number one it's a true sport watch right 10 bars of water resistance on a bracelet three hand movement it's a no date but this is very much a go anywhere do anything it's got the water resistance it's got a square case so it's a little bit dressy on a bracelet. It's very sporty. It's got the, oh, what's the jewel I'm looking for? The blue jewel. Is that topaz? Maybe? Sapphire. It's got sapphire on the crown. It's very decorated. It's coming from a jewelry company. It's finishing is off the hook. So this is it. This is the cornerstone of my to watch collection.</td>

By modern standards, a dress watch. Yeah, I think so. But it's not, it's a pure to its core sport watch. And I, the Roman numerals really help in the dressiness, the kind of, the super plain dial outside of the Roman numerals really help with that. But the heat blued hands, it's just, it's fucking gorgeous. We all know the Santos, we all love it. This is my first pick and it's my cornerstone.</td>

<td>Will</td>
<td>You know, when- This is the, this is the only, watch with Roman numerals that I like because it just works for some reason. And they put the Cartier text in it. It's in the, in the V, the, you know, the V of the seven, which is so cool. You know, I only watch with Roman numerals that I like.</td>

I'm just saying, I would, I, I'd do some bad things to a crash. I just could never justify buying a crash because it's so obscure. Um, but the Reverso is dope. Um, but the Santos is, is, is like really just peak shit for me. So it had to be my pick and it's, it's my, my first pick.</td>

I don't need a chronograph. I would like a chronograph, but I don't need one.  That's a third watch. I'm totally good with the Santos and a diver leaving. What are we at?

The Monta Triumph, right?  This every time I look at one of these nine and a half millimeters steel sport watches, I come back to the triumph and I'm like, this does that.

I mean, there's moments in almost every single episode where the humor is quick, but the emotions are really heavy. I really liked that show, even though I'm with you, Will.

I'm still waiting for mine. Uh, so I'm a big Jurassic park guy, like nerd to my core love dinosaurs. As a result of my childhood interaction with Jurassic park, I introduced that to my seven year old who has subsequently come become a dinosaur nerd. We went and saw Jurassic park, the minion in theaters.  And it's not a theater necessary movie. But I loved it. The new generation of Jurassic Park is new generation of movies, right? It's blockbuster movies. It's all action all the time. Story leaves you a little bit wanting, but there's just enough there to keep you there. The new trilogy. But you're gonna get action. You're gonna get dinosaurs and people. You're gonna get dinosaurs and dinosaurs. And you're gonna be thoroughly entertained.  It was worth it in theaters.</td>

Starship Troopers is one of my favorite movies. It's amazing. Yeah, it's wholly different than the book. If they were to do Starship Troopers now and keep it true to the book, it wouldn't be better than the first Starship Troopers because that's its own thing.  It would be a terrific movie.</td>

So she thinks she's really mature. And in some ways she is, she had the sort of wherewithal to come to me and say, I need to, I can't read this.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>That's how you know it's true. I, you know, two summers apart had the same experience. Uh, so we, um, I started listening to a podcast called Witnessed Friendly Fire.  If you've ever listened to the Borderlands Witnessed Borderlands podcast, this is, it's, it's sort of a true crime sort of in the, in the vein of This American Life, or perhaps even Radiolab, you know, the modern, highly produced investigative journalism type of podcast. This Friendly Fire, Witnessed Friendly Fire is, I think you can get all the episodes now.  However, if you go, I think Apple's maybe got like a bundled podcast thing where you can get all the unreleased stuff. However, if you're just like me on pocket cast, we're on episode seven of, I think, 11 episodes. It's a story about a police officer in a small, in a small town, uh, who gets shot by his, who gets shot by his partner. Uh, and, it's reported as an accident and there's never, you know, the investigation kind of also determines that it's an accident, but you then learn, well, actually there's a lot to this. So takes place in Scott County, Tennessee is the name of the County. Um, and, and, you know, like any good investigative journalism, Podcasts, they're revealing the story in a compelling way. The storytelling is done really well. Their production is really good, but I, these come out on Monday morning for me. Maybe they come out on Saturday or Sunday or something, but Monday morning is when I refresh my podcast feed and it's always there 45 minutes to an hour episodes. And I'm like hooked. I'm hooked Monday morning. I'm refreshing so I can listen to this thing. Uh, Really, really good. Sean Flynn is the name of the reporter. He's actually from Scott County, and I think he reported this story when it happened, maybe 15 or 16 years ago. And he's now revisiting it based on the additional information that's come forward. Spoiler alert, the shooter has some problems, but we're talking about law enforcement conspiracies, all the stuff.  all the stuff and it's just really, really good. You know, like all true crime. It's, it feels a little pulpy. It feels a little, uh, it's a guilty pleasure perhaps, but totally enjoyable. Recommended witnessed friendly fire podcast.</td>

<td>Hey, well, thanks. Thanks for being here. This was fun. Well, we'll have to do it again. Next time you want to tell us what show we're going to do for the week. Uh, and thank you guys. Thank you guys for joining us for another, another episode of 40 and 20 watch clicker podcast. Uh, if you'd like, check us out on our website, watch clicker.com. We post multiple, multiple articles and reviews.  per week. And also every episode of this podcast, you can check Will out at Watch Clicker on Instagram and us at 40 and 20 on Instagram. If you want to support what we do at Watch Clicker, because hosting all these things, all these things that you probably have, don't even think about, they all cost a lot of money. You can do that at patreon.com slash 40 and 20. That is one of the main ways we generate income for the things we do have to do for the show and the website.  And yeah, and don't forget to tune back in next Thursday for another hour of watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like. Bye bye.</td>
