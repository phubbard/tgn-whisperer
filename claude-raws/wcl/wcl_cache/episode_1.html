<td>Hello, fellow watch lovers, nerds, enthusiasts, or whoever you identify. This is 1420 Podcast with your host, Andrew, and my good friend Everett. Here, we talk about watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like. Thanks for joining us on our inaugural episode, and we hope you enjoy the journey with us. Today, we're going to talk a little bit about us, who we are, and our journey into watches. Everett, you got me into this thing, into the watch journey. So why don't you tell me a little bit about how you got there, your first watch, and anything else you think's relevant.  Hey, Andrew. Hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>How you doing? Just, you know, I'm probably too far away from the microphone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Who knows? We'll see. This is the first one. So we'll just kind of feel it out from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>We're going to have some growing pains. So yeah, I got into watches. I guess it's been, uh, three or four years now. I've been really, I guess, collecting, um, got into watches. I don't even remember how I did it. It was, you know, I think we're both sort of internet people. Uh, You know, I, I'm always looking up new things and I like, um, you know, finding, finding new toys or new gadgets or gizmos or things to be into. Uh, you know, so my wife's dismay, I always, I remember I was at work. I was working at a law firm in Portland at the time and, um, just found, uh, found some watches and I, uh, found the, what I, what I found was the Seiko SKX.  Uh, the famous sort of entry level diver, I think it's probably the first watch for, you know, some huge percentage of folks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Probably half the people, everyone else is an SNK.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right. Yeah. One of those two, it seems like, uh, and pretty quickly, you know, I, I had never been on watch forums or, or anything. And I remember thinking at the time that there were just sort of a, uh, mind numbing amount of options. Um, you know, I'm pretty sure, I don't remember because it's been long enough ago, but there was a discussion, I'm pretty sure it was the discussion about the SKX007K versus J. And now these are terms I'm really comfortable with and I know the controversy or the non-controversy, whatever it is. But at the time I remember thinking, gosh, this is going to be really hard to know which one to get and reading about it and having a lot of like trouble knowing which one to get. And then, you know, in that conversation, finding people who were into to Orient, the Orient Mako, you know, I think that that becomes the first question for folks when they're buying a lot of folks, when they're buying that first watch, you know, first question is which, which new watch should I buy? And the answer is SKX or Mako. Um, and I remember sort of encountering that and looking at the Mako and thinking, I don't know, which one should I get? And they're the same price and they're, you know, very similarly spec'd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I have the same internal monologue. And the only reason I went with the Mako is because you already had the SKX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right. I think I was talking to someone about that the other day. So, um, for me at the end of the day, um, after much sort of hemming and hawing, I picked this watch up and I, I pretty sure I ordered it on Amazon and I ordered it on a bracelet, um, which I love.  By the way, I think some people don't know, you know, whether or not they're going to like that bracelet. It's this cheap jangly, uh, you know, I've got it right here. Uh, it's this cheap jangly kind of terrible bracelet, uh, hollow end links, um, you know, pin and collar pin and collar links. Um, but at the end of the day, it winds up being insanely comfortable. I love the way it looks. I love the, uh, contrast between brushed surfaces and polished surfaces. I mean, the whole thing is just super duper cool. So that was my first watch and that was my first watch journey. I think it's probably, uh, the same or similar watch experience that, you know, 80% of folks that get into watches have, you know, and, I don't remember what it costs, but it was probably in the 180 to 220 range. And at the, you know, at the time that seemed like really a significant amount of money to spend on a watch at the time. Um, and it is, you know, realistically, it's not, it's not a cheap watch. Um, and I, and I love it. I mean, I still have it. Obviously we've got it here, Andrews.</td>

<td>Andrew</td>
<td>shaking it shaking it well i and one of the things that i always i've always thought was funny about this bracelet is it seems so flimsy and you can you can feel that it's it's not a sturdy bracelet at all but it's insanely comfortable i mean the thing the thing flops over almost like it's like it's a nato or something like it's just there's no structure to it but it's just so comfortable you know it's funny you see people um i don't know maybe you don't see people but you know there's the</td>

<td>Everett</td>
<td>the Rolex Jubilee bracelet stretch thing. And you see every time someone sells a Datejust or something with a Jubilee, they hold the watch up so you can see how much bracelet stretch is. And when they do it, the bracelet supports itself. And you know, it sags a little bit. Oh, that's some bracelet stretch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's below. I mean, the links are below. I'm holding it sideways here. And as you hold it, hold it like vertically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>the anybody who's below it i mean it's it's such a flimsy comfortable bracelet anybody who's got one knows it's there's no there's no uh sticking it straight out because it just it just falls straight over so amazingly comfortable it's like a pair of pjs and you know the skx i'm still if i had to go back and make that same decision today i'd make the same decision over again i love the case of the skx i love i mean really i i think it's some like crazy pinnacle of of watch design at that level you know the the organic case if you haven't you know if you're listening to this and you haven't seen uh skx before take a look at one i think that's probably no one that's listening to this episode but i just love the way that four o'clock crown guard wraps into the case i love the the really soft um you know the the way the edges all sort of round over into one another and the It just looks sturdy. And I love it. I really love it. I mean, I would make the same decision again. Now, obviously you, you, uh, have a Mako and I've had an opportunity to, to be hands-on with that also a fantastic watch. And I wouldn't be sad to have a Mako. Um, if I had gone back and ordered the other one, I think that would have been fine, but as it is something about that brand Seiko's got this just really incredible brand they've got.  this thing, uh, that I really like the, the brand has this thing that I really like. And you know, there are other Japanese brands, obviously Orient, um, Citizen, Miyota, Casio, the, the, you know, the big sort of four Japanese brands. They, they've got these things that I don't, um, I don't find in, or Seiko's got this thing that I don't find in these other brands. It's really mythical.  you know, subjective, intangible factor about Sega that I just love. So, um, yeah, that was the start of it. I got that. I think I got an SNK. I found an SNK on Amazon. They, you know, when the SNK is dipped down to like 40 bucks, I was like, I'm buying that. So I picked up an SNK and then, you know, that was the beginning of it. That's been, that's been three or four years at this point. I've bought, you know, one or two watches since then. One or two.  As have you. So I think really that's the, that's the gist of it. I mean, if you're getting to know me and my watch journey, that's, that's how it started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And I think if we're talking about buying watches, you want to talk about the Emperor? Oh, the Emperor that you're wearing. Yeah. Just get a little, a little plug for the Emperor you got on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So folks, those of you listening here, I, I assume without knowing that, that anybody who's not my mom, uh, who, who is listening to this is going to see the post. I'm probably going to try to sneak on to, Watch You Seek this week. I don't know if it's allowed or not. Someone's going to say, you can't advertise your own podcast, but it's safe to say neither Andrew or I are going to make money off of certainly not this episode. No chance. But yeah, so I'm in the, I am participating in the Watch You Seek F71. That's the affordables forum. But the F71 2017 Project Watch. And now it's, you know, we're knocking on 2019.  These project watches take a tremendous amount of time, but for those of you who don't know, you have the opportunity to sign up with a watch you seek every couple of years to participate in a project watch. And the folks who sign up get to participate in the decision-making process. So we, you know, you vote on band style and dial features. And I participated in the 2017, I am participating in the 2017 project watch.  It's the Emperor Diver. It is a vintage style, 40 millimeter diver. The perfect dimensions for a watch. I think Andrew and I are sort of in agreement, are 40 millimeters and 20 millimeters. That's what this is. 40 millimeter diver, vintage sort of skin diver styling. If you haven't checked it out, check it out. They're steel bezeled, 120 click, unidirectional dive watches, screw down crown.  All the things that make a dive watch a dive watch. I think probably at this point, more people have seen the HKED, Hong Kong ED, and EMG watches, the Nemo Diver, which is, you know, I don't know the full story here. You'd have to ask Ed, but I'm pretty sure when we were getting signups for the Emperor Diver, we just weren't, we didn't have the numbers we needed. And Ed, obviously, HKED. I think that's how you say it. I've never thought about it before. I've always said it like that. HKED. HKED.</td>

HK designed the Nemo diver, which is also a skin diver retro for, you know, it's, it's, everything's the same. The dial is different. The bezel is different, but at this point they did, they've had a successful Kickstarter. I think they reached their goal this last week and it was a pretty low goal. I think 10,000 I last I saw there were 10, six. Um, but they ended this week and I don't know if you can still order it or not, but it's beautiful. It's a beautiful watch.  Um, really, really cool, really special. Um, but this is the, the, the birth point of that, you know, the emperor diver was, was the watch that was there was here first. And, and without that, you wouldn't have the Nemo and, uh, just super cool watch. I've had a prototype now for about a week, not quite a week. It'll be a week. I'm supposed to send it somewhere tomorrow. Um, but I've been wearing it. I've been wearing it constantly. It is.  freaking amazing. Perfect. So it's a, um, like I said, 40 millimeter, 20 millimeter beads of rice bracelet. And this thing is nuts. Also super comfortable. It feels like wearing leather. Yeah. It feels like wearing leather. Yeah. I mean, it, it really, you know, you said that earlier and I thought that's totally right. Uh, super flexible. I've, I've sort of had mixed feelings about beads of rice bracelets in the past. They have that real, like, sort of vintage charm, but it's a vintage charm that I didn't particularly ascribe to. You know, you see DOXAs or whatever on pizza rice bracelets, and I thought, well, if I get a DOXA, maybe I'll get a pizza rice. But outside of that, I'm not feeling it. Incredible. In person, there's nothing I don't like about it. It looks good. It feels amazing. The watch size is really good. It's this 40 millimeter sizing. And even on a dive watch, I think people, the common Um, the, the, the common, the, the community sort of wants a diver to be a little bit bigger than 40. Obviously you've got like the NTH divers, the NTH subs, those are all 40 millimeters, wildly successful. But the community at large, I think wants its divers a little bit bigger. I'm, I'm on board. 40 millimeters, great size.</td>

<td>That's it. Yeah. I don't know. I love seeing it. I was looking forward to seeing it all week. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's, it's everything I was hoping for. Are you going to buy one?  I think so. They'll be around. You'll be able to pick them up. That's another one of those conversations. That one's got to get taken home for. And commit to it.</td>

<td>Got to talk to the wife. Exactly. I've got a friend from work, and he's said he's going to buy one, but he was supposed to PayPal me money last week. Oh, I couldn't figure out PayPal. I'll drop you off a check. I still haven't seen a check. You can't figure out PayPal? That's what I said. Who doesn't have PayPal in 2018?</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You know, I've been using PayPal for years, so I've got it like linked up to my bank account. I think it does an ACH transfer when you've got it actually connected to your bank account. But I'm pretty sure you could like in 10 minutes sign up for PayPal, make a payment using a credit card in your pocket, maybe, maybe less than that, you know? So I don't know. He's, that's why I think maybe that's the point.  He wants to do it.</td>

<td>That's a good beer. So Andrew is a beer salesman. He sells beer. Yeah, for money. Sorry to brag. To the world. We're drinking this 10 Barrel Brewing Company. Their Crush Line. If you haven't tried it, it's phenomenal. I don't know where everybody is. I think you can get it just about anywhere now, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I mean, I don't know.</td>

<td>Shit, that's been a long time now. It was two years ago, yeah. And they've doubled in size since then.</td>

<tr>

<td>They built this incredible facility in Bend. I mean, it's just, you'd look at it, it just looks like a huge warehouse. But inside is this, I don't know, 10 million, what did the guy say? Six million dollar robot, basically. Yeah, basically. That just bottles and Anyway, they've turned, they were this tiny little quaint Bend, Oregon company making sick beers a few years ago. And now they're this mega Anheuser-Busch, megalith, but they still make phenomenal beers. The Sour Cucumber Crush, Cucumber Sour Crush, still probably to this day my favorite beer on the Facebook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It tastes like, it tastes like the, uh, like, uh, one of the, the monk beers, the, uh, kind of, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Lambic. Yeah. That's sort of what it is. I mean, they're just, they're a Creek Lambic Creek. Yeah. I mean, they're sour mashed sours. So they sour it in the, in the brew kettle. They just like let it sit there. And so I've made some, so I also brew beer, uh, and one of the, uh, I've made a couple of these and you just like, You draw all the sugar out of the grains in whatever you're mashing in, which is when you're basically steeping your grains to pull the sugar out to ferment. And then you just wrap it in a blanket and keep it at a warm temperature for a couple days and taste it every couple days. And when it's as sour as you want, then you start working on it.  And do you add bacteria to it or is it like the bacteria is just like letting milk go bad bacteria in the world. Yeah, like a sourdough fermentation or something. Yeah, just get some funk that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And it's the same flavor as as a sourdough, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, it's that same. I don't acid. What is the lactobacillus is what comes in like sour like fermented, but I could be wrong. I don't I've heard people talk of lactobacillus. I've never brewed one like that. All my sours have been sour mashed. Andrew's also a beer scientist. Anyway, so my watch, not my beer journey, my beer journey is slightly different and longer, but my watch journey started as I was like becoming a grownup. Always like in the small details are, if you can get the small things right, the big things are going to follow. And I felt like going into job interviews and becoming a grownup, a watch was kind of critical to that. And I didn't know, anything about watches uh and i was searching like doing the internet thing and just searching because i knew i needed a watch but i didn't know i didn't know a timex from a citizen from a seiko like i just i just didn't so i started looking on it started looking digging digging digging digging i wanted to find a watch that i could wear at a job interview at work doing stuff find a job or just find a watch that would</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Like every day, I look universally good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. Um, which is harder and pretty hard to find. Uh, and I, I had a friend who wore a citizen eco drive and I liked the way it looked. I liked the solar power. Cause one of the things that I'm terrible at is replacing watch batteries. Uh, I have probably a dozen sport watches, um, that are just dead. I mean, all I need to do is buy a battery for it and it's good. Um, but I have probably a dozen of them, like in various drawers around the house of just Watch doesn't need a battery. So I knew what I knew about me was that I needed a watch that I didn't have to replace the battery on because the moment that that watch battery died, it was just, that was going to get thrown away. So I started digging. I started looking at citizen. I liked the eco drive because I liked the solar powered. Uh, and I started looking through their whole lineup. I wanted a leather band. I wasn't a big fan of bracelets at the time. And still I'm, I'm not a huge fan of bracelets. Cause I find that most of them are uncomfortable.  And I'm not a hairy guy. So when things pull my hair, like pull my arm hair, it's like mildly offensive to me because there's no reason for something to be pulling my minimal arm hair. So, uh, what I went to, what I eventually decided on, I tried on dozens of watches. I'd go to every department store and every everywhere I could find to just try on watches. And what I settled on was the citizen, the aviator watch.</td>

<td>Yeah, but what's comfortable? Do you like what you wear? Yeah, the two bracelets that you're wearing, I like. The Mako bracelet pulls my arm hair. It's a comfortable bracelet, but those two on the Emperor and on the SKX feel like wearing leather, or they feel like wearing a NATO. They're comfortable. I haven't worn either of them long enough to have it pull my arm hair.</td>

<td>I've got the, you know, that Seiko, the BFK. I don't think that's its actual name, but the big freaking Seiko, big freaking kinetic. Yeah, yeah. And it's not it's an oyster style or maybe it's not an oyster style, but it's that same three wing.  But there's only two links. And that bracelet I think is so fantastic, but it's heavy and kind of clunky and it doesn't, it's not super flexible. Yeah, there's no flex in the Mayo bracelet. I don't think I've ever owned a true Oyster style bracelet. It's my, well, my Saab, I guess. As I sit here today, I don't know if it's three-piece or not. So I wonder if there's something like the more link, maybe more links across you know a jubilee anybody who's who's listening will know what jubilee is a five right you've got the two bigger and the three smaller but i've never you know i suspect i've got more hair on my wrist than you do i've never had i hear people say this all the time or i read i don't hear because you know we live on the internet and yes i never hear anybody right i didn't realize i didn't know how to say hcat until today today so You know, there's a lot of the, you know, it's funny listening.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So I, I, I picked the citizen.  It came on a leather bracelet that was- Do you have a model number on that? It's the AW1360-12H. That's a model. Yeah, it is. And I loved it. I tried it on, I bought it. It's really comfortable, the bracelet or the leather strap that it came with. After two years of hard wear, shows minimal wear on it. I have it on actually a NATO that you made now, a leather NATO that you made.  uh, which I like more. It's just a little bit lighter weight. Uh, and the only complaint I have about it is that it's just a little bit big. I'm not a big frame guy. I mean, I'm, I'm five foot nine and little, little petite bird bones in me. Um, but we have the same size wrist, which is, which is weird. Um, but yeah, I, um, it wears just a little big and, and like we talked about earlier, I sell beer.  So I spent a lot of time in coolers. So I'm always wearing a jacket and that actually turned out to be a nice touch was that it can stand up to my jacket. It doesn't just get buried or disappear. I'm not constantly fumbling with pulling my sleeve up. So it's nice. It actually, I can kind of wear it in that like an aviator fashion of being able to see my watch. Uh, the visibility is great on it. The illumination is really great on it. Um, and it's, it's, I mean, I've never had to charge it. I don't know.  It's like a four day battery life reserve in there. So is any, it even charges under, um, under light bulb light. So it doesn't have to be natural light. It takes longer to charge, but in the entire three, four years that I've had it, I've, it's never gone dead. It's never even gone to the five second for every second. Cause one of the battery reserve measures is that it reduces, like it, it reduces its effort by.  when the battery is at like 20%, it goes to like a one to three seconds. So for every one second, it moves for every three seconds, it moves once. So it stutters a little bit. It's a little bit stuttery, but that's by design.</td>

And you introduced me to automatic watches and the mechanical watches. And then we started talking about this project and that's really where it pushed me over the edge from always having a fascination in watches and knowing the watches were important to recognizing that there's more to watches than fossil. Uh, so that was, I mean, you were kind of my, my stepping off point. Um, and I mean, still to this day, one of my, my, uh, my bucket list watches is, um, uh, shoot, what's the brand of Detroit?

And when I saw them, I was like, Oh, these are, these are really cool watches, but what's the difference between that and a fossil or a citizen or, um, any other dozen watch brands out there?  And they're still on the bucket list, especially with now having just released an automatic diver, which I know you said you weren't like that big of a fan of, but I'm, they're just, they're, I think there's a dozen watches I'm ready to buy before I'm ready to buy one of those.</td>

I don't know what their experience in automatics movements are, but I know there's a lot of excitement about this R150 movement, but shit, if it's going to be, you know, if it's going to be in watches that are comparing with, you know, these, these high end Swiss watches, you know, Ronda is obviously a fantastic old Swiss quality company, but I'm thinking, you know, you've got, Neoda 9 series movements or Seiko NH35 or even ETA movements are coming in in watches that are selling between $500 and $1,000. So I don't know that we know how much this movement is going to cost and I think people are really excited about it.

<td>Uh, one watch actually that popped up in my, in my consciousness this week is lawyer, lawyer watches, um, which has sent me them. They're fantastic. Neptune diver watches is doing, um, a re-release of the Neptune. They're calling it the Neptune series two. So the, the lawyer Neptune, fantastic, uh, micro brand dive watch 39 millimeter, Um, case, which is actually pretty small for a dive watch. The thing about the Neptune that I never actually loved is the, the bezel and, uh, the, the proportion of the case size to the diver seemed, or to the dial seemed off to me, uh, sort of a too, too much, too much bezel, not enough, not enough dial. Well, so they're, they're re-releasing the Neptune series two, which has fixed exactly that problem there.  Uh, it's, it's just got a bigger dial. So the proportions are a lot better. I don't know when these are set to come out. I think it's happening pretty soon. Um, it's a, again, 39 millimeter dive watch, really a sort of classically styled dive watch, 12 millimeters thick. It's an NH35 Seiko movement. So hacking, hand winding 20 millimeter band size, which again, that's, yeah.  Any watch with the 20 millimeter band is on my radar. 120 click, unidirectional, all the dive stuff. It's got an oyster style bracelet, but it's got this great taper. So it tapers from 20 to 16, so a four millimeter taper, which I think that's just about perfect. I love a really well tapered dive watch. In fact, I've got a Super Engineer, a Strapcode Super Engineer bracelet that doesn't taper at all.  hate it. It's a $70 hunk of metal that sits in my closet that I'll never wear. I should probably sell it, but I just hate it. I love a really nice taper on a, on a bracelet. They've got, um, the, the Neptune has an acrylic, um, an acrylic crystal, which some people don't like, you know, that Emperor Diver that, that the F71 Project Watch is a sapphire, a domed sapphire, but, but the, the Laurier has a more classic, um, acrylic or it says plexiglass. I don't know if there's a difference between plexiglass or acrylic, but it's a soft plastic crystal. Um, anyway, just, just a really phenomenal watch. And so the, the, the cool thing is as they're coming out with this, uh, Neptune, they're also releasing some other models. And I think all of the models use the same case. There's another dive watch that has, um, bezel without numerical markings it's got markings but no numbers on it and I think the idea is you could use it as a 12-hour 12-hour sort of dual time or you could use it as a minute timer Any bezel you can use as a timer so right so but it's cool.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I mean a cool aesthetic It's I mean, I like that aesthetic. I like the diversity in bezels, so</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Oh, I love a 12 hour. I actually wish they would just have made it a 12 hour because I love a 12 hour dual timer. But the cool one, so they're releasing a model called the Falcon, which is, as far as I can tell, same exact case, same dimensions, 39 by 12 by 20. But instead of having a rotating dive bezel, it's got a fixed steel brushed or or maybe uh blasted bezel they're calling it their dress tool watch which i think is super cool uh the dimensions are perfect for that type of watch um and and the dress tool watch i think at least for me and i think probably for you as well is this great uh this this great sort of underutilized mode of watches. You know, everybody wants to either have a dress watch or they want to have a sort of beefy dive watch. The middle ground that the Explorers and the, and the Sards, you know, these dress tool watches are awesome. So it's a, it's a 39 millimeter brushed or, you know, I don't know. I hope they do like a radial brush. That'd be cool. I'd like it. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like a tapered bezel. I kind of wish they'd, they brought it up, made it flat, like sort of, Royal Oak or Nautilus style, but it looks like it's going to be tapered. But it's 200 millimeters, screw down crown, just a no shit, fully spec'd dive watch, but that has this really sort of everyday aesthetic. Honeycomb dial, super cool honeycomb dial. The only thing that I'm not super sure about is it looks to me like all the different colorways and they've got a green and maybe a red, I don't know, a bunch of different colorways.  It looks to me like they're all gilt handsets. And I don't know what I think about that. I wish they had a more traditional steel handset. Maybe they will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm interested by the dress tool. I think that's, I think that's a good middle ground for people. I mean, especially for somebody who's not looking to buy a handful of watches, somebody who's trying to just get a single-purpose watch. I mean, me, as I'm getting into the watch trade, I'm thinking about someone like me who's like, well, I know I need a watch, but what the hell am I supposed to get? Something like that, that crosses all the boundaries. It's truly a functional watch. It looks good and you can wear it basically whenever. And then when you bang it into things, you don't break down in tears. And that's, I mean, that's kind of what got me out of it.</td>

<td>It could be, I don't know. I haven't seen the, I don't recall seeing the renderings of it, or even maybe the prototypes, but it could be it. Let's pull it up. It could be a bit of a turn off. And while you're doing that, I'll talk about what I've got on the horizon. So the Orient Neo 70s, earlier I said that it was the Defender, and it's not the Defender. I think the Defender is one of the, one with a sub-dial, but the Neo 70s is another Eco Drive from the Orient, or solar powered, or whatever, because of Eco Drive Citizen, but it's a solar powered.  and the first time I saw it, I was like, ooh, ooh, I need you. And I showed you a picture of it, didn't I?</td>

<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah, no, I've seen it. That's the same watch that Casimir's wore for his... Yeah, and they look great. He's got his Christmas chrono. Yeah, yeah.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>It's the same bracelet. I'm pretty sure. I'm going to put it on an 8-0. The bracelet will probably never get worn, but I like them. And the deep blue, just being that we're talking about watches kind of in that segment, the Mako, the SKX, I think adding a deep blue to the conversation will be beneficial because I like them. I think they look cool. They're a little bit bigger than the SKX and that's something that kind of gives me a little bit of hesitation because I don't like watches that wear big. A big watch is fine, but when it feels big, I mean, there's a difference. Like in the way it contours a little bit, like the Aviator feels big, the SKX does not.</td>

<td>Yeah, right. So I'm going to give it a try and we'll we'll see how it works out. So between the the neo 70s and the and the deep blue, those are kind of my two on the horizon. And obviously I have, you know, my someday watches. I started looking at the Strella chronographs. Mm hmm. They're just I found one on eBay that had it was it was obviously like 30 years old. So there was like even the even the dial was kind of starting to like wear from being in this, like from just light exposure. Tropical. Yeah. Oh man.

<td>I'm sort of negative. You know, uh, I'm not negative about the watch itself. You know, I think that the Deep Blue Diver winds up doing a lot of the things that everybody wants Seiko to do with the SKX. The problem is, well, and what I mean by that is, you know, I think it's a sapphire crystal. It's a NH35. So hacking, hand winding movement, all these things that every watch that gets sold today has, you know, the Seiko SKX is sort of a throwback in terms of its, its features. So it's really a modern, a modern iteration. The problem is if Seiko did it, it'd be a thousand bucks, you know, or 800 bucks. And they're selling it at a really, competitive price point. Yeah. I mean, they're always there. It's a, it's a touch bigger, right?</td>

So, um, yeah, the only other watch I've been, I've been looking at, and I'm not even sure it's a, it's a watch per se. Well, it is a watch, but, uh, not, not, not a model that, that I expected to find. So I watched a movie, a new Joaquin Phoenix movie, uh, recently called you were never really here. I never even heard of that.  So it's a newish movie. I'd never heard of it either. I saw it on Netflix or Amazon, one of the two. I can never remember.</td>

<td>Was that the documentary he made after his performance art?</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>No, it is not. That's a hilarious movie. No, it's sort of a John Wick style. He plays a contract killer or an assassin or something, a former Marine, and he's just this you know, maybe borderline mentally ill, contract killer, uh, super bad-ass. Um, but, but less, less, uh, like Kung Fu bad-ass than John Wick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>More just, I think is actually what John Wick is called.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>More just like kind of scary and fearless. And, uh, it's actually a really good movie. It kind of reminded me a little bit of taxi driver, um, in terms of the content. And I, I saw some other comparisons online, but he's wearing this military watch.  uh throughout the movie and it's you can tell it's kind of a small really classically styled military watch so i did what you do and you know right you go into like the watch like what did he wear in this movie and they have there's like whole websites dedicated to like what watches have been featured in tv shows and movies or actors or yeah that's right yeah pretty much exactly that and so i found a couple i think i found a watchuseek thread and a reddit thread but um i don't know that this is the watch he's wearing but In fact, I think he's wearing a slightly different watch, but I found this website that I'd never been on. Maybe you've heard, but it's called Sportsman's Guide, sportmanguide.com. Actually, as I sit here, I don't know if that's right or not. It's either sportmanguide or sportmansguide.com and they sell military surplus and sort of hunting stuff, but they sell a couple of lines of military watches, sort of unbranded. I think the brand is U.S. Guide, but they're I'm intrigued. They are insanely cheap. So I'm pretty sure that the one that's closest to what Joaquin Phoenix is wearing is this like classic Vietnam style, stainless steel military watch 30 bucks, $29.99 on the website, 19 millimeter lugs, according to one of the comments in the FAQ. Um, but just a super classic, it says quote unquote Japanese quartz. So I dunno, it's probably a Hattori or a, Miyota, some sort of super cheap Japanese Quartz module.</td>

<td>Yeah, I'm on it right now. That's just like you, you're a Sportman's. Yeah, multiple. Japanese Quartz, I mean, it's this really kind of generic, but for 30 bucks, I think I'm going to probably take a flyer on one and see what it is.  I was intrigued watching him wear this watch. I thought, it's a cool looking watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You know, 30 bucks, it comes with two straps. To comment on how cheap they are. I mean, the first one, I searched watch on their website. The first hit is two military style army watches, two pack, one black, one olive drab, non-member, $19.99. Right. And those are the plastic ones, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Probably. Yeah. So they've got, I think they've got a plastic version and a steel version.  Uh, pretty, pretty cool. So, uh, yeah, that's what I've been looking at.</td>

<td>Andrew</td>
<td>They had some funny watch. There are a lot of pocket watches on here, which are, but they're not even real pocket watches. They're just on like snap links.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I'm sure for 30 bucks, you're getting a terrible watch and they have some weird brands too. You know what? They're obviously not a watch place. I saw at one point the measurements were like, someone's like, how big is this watch? And they're like, Oh, it's, such and such inches by like they're not selling watches they don't know how to sell watches necessarily they're just they just found these things in their soul but yeah i found it intriguing i'll probably pick one up they're actually pretty cool i'll report the case like wraps around the crown a little bit i kind of actually the strap is even kind of cool</td>

<td>Just like a U.S. stamp on the dial.</td>

<td>U.S. Guide. Yeah. So there's a, these I think are brand U.S. Guide. There's also a brand called U.S. Time. And I think that U.S. Time are slightly more expensive. I don't know anything about either of these brands. Maybe we'll try to figure it out, but yeah. So as far as watches, do you have anything else you're looking at moving forward? I mean, besides all the hundred billion watches that you want to buy?</td>

Cause if I accidentally check out and I'm drinking, then suddenly I've got a bunch of watches, but I think they must be on the wishlist. So is that actually happening? You buying that? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to get that. The orange scuba dude, the, uh, I settled on the orange bezel. I think it's going to look really cool. Yeah. Yeah. Get it on a bracelet. We'll, we'll see how it turns out. I wore yours for like a week and a half.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>And I get it on one of their NATOs when I bought my Bowstock. I bought it also from A.M. Diver. I got it on one of their NATOs, and the NATO kind of sucks. It's not terrible, but it's not my favorite NATO.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>So if the bracelet turns out to suck, the bracelet sucks. I didn't pay any more for it. Right. And I have a pile of NATOs. Right.  We're not, we're not worrying here about the, about the bracelet that's going on. Do you have the strap that's going on too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So I think the, the last segment we have sort of not, not watch things. We're going to try to spend some time, I think every week on, on not watch things that we're, we're into. Um, you got some cool stuff. What, what, what are the not watch things that have caught your attention?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So the not watch things is obviously, um, well, YouTube can, everyone's gone down to YouTube rabbit hole and then looked up at the clock and been many hours later or gone home from work after having accomplished nothing. And Hot Ones, uh, I can't remember the guy's name. I watched way too much of it. Sean Evans. Yeah. Yeah. So hot ones with Sean Evans by, uh, first we feast has, um, which is I think a complex, a complex magazine brand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>They, it has been, um, I don't know the bulk of my day. If we're, if we're going to break, if we're going to pie chart the hours in my day, Hot Ones takes up probably more than sleep at this point. And it's awesome. Because who doesn't like watching videos of celebrities trying to eat through super spicy hot wings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So if you haven't watched if you haven't watched Hot Ones, it's a it's a interview segment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Sean Evans brings these celebrities on. I mean, whether it be like actors or recording artists or comedians or just I mean, a really impressive bench of folks coming in, agreeing to subject themselves to this. And his whole interview format is they sit down with 10 wings varying of, of increasingly of, of hotness, I don't know, increasing hotness. Uh, so each of the wing sauces go up in Scoville. So they start with like Tapatio or, and actually I was surprised at how hot, uh, Tapatio was. Cause I feel like I could drink Tapatio.  Um, but it's, it's, it's usually like number two or three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I was surprised the Tapatio and Tabasco are, they, according to Hot Ones, they're the same spicy, but I think Tabasco is quite a bit spicier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, I think, I think the vinegar punch in Tabasco is what like amps it up. But anyway, they start at one at like, I don't know, a hundred or a couple hundred Scoville units. And they go all the way up to one at 10 Scoville, 10, 10 million, I think is what like the hottest one. The last dab. The last dab, which is horrifying.  I think, but I want to buy some and try it. We should do some hot wings next time. And we'll just do this while we're eating a bunch of the last dab. Anyway, so he does. It's this format where he's interviewing folks as they eat these incrementally more and more spicy wings. And it's really interesting to see the way that people, the way that spiciness like breaks down people's defense mechanisms. And by the way, Sean Evans is a beast. I've never seen him react.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>at all i think he i think that his uh reaction sort of match the guest a lot of times so if the guest is really hurting it seems like he hurts more versus a guest that's super cool i don't know i feel like the more they hurt you the more he like he looks at him just goes so wait adam carolla was on this week's episode and it seemed like neither one of them was even eating hot wings you know yeah or alton brown ate it and it was just like this is whatever this is rachel ray was like</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>like drinking. Yeah. And, and, and meanwhile, uh, DJ Collin just tapped out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You played yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. And who, who was the guy who started at number 10?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Oh, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Eddie Wang. Yeah. Eddie, Eddie Wang. He started, Eddie Huang sits down and he, he looks down this, this like flight board of wings and, and he got kind of a crazy look in his eyes and he just ate the 10th wing.  Yeah. And then they had their like technical difficulty while he went to the bathroom. He shit himself. He shit himself. Yeah. He shit himself right there. Uh, so he didn't eat any more wings, but he started at the hottest one. Apparently that's not the right way to do it. Um, but anyway, so I've been watching a lot of that and it's a funny interview format. And I think that one of the things that's most interesting to me is that you get to see people's defense mechanism break down. You see like the character that they have in the public eye break down as they're working their way through these hotter and hotter wings. Cause they can't, It takes energy to maintain a public persona. And when you're focusing all your energy on not dying or not shitting yourself, you come out. And it's been a really fascinating interview format to see. And then the other one that I've been doing a lot of, because I drive a lot for work, because I've been listening to Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, who's always been somebody that interested me, because he's like, he, he kind of pops in and out of public view and he's married to like an extremely popular, well-known actress. And it's always been a Disney princess, literally a Disney princess. And he's always been somebody who I've, I've liked everything he's done, everything that I've, everything he's done that I've seen. And I like, I, I saw that he had a podcast and I was like, Oh, cool. Cause I listened to a lot of podcasts. I drive a lot and he, uh, his podcast is killer. It's a two hour format. He sits down with like he, his, It kind of started off with like his famous friends who are, I mean, he's friends with some pretty famous people. So his, his interview bench is deep. Uh, and then suddenly Kate Couric shows up. We're famous too. Yeah. Come on over. We'll just talk about what we don't have to talk about watches. If you come over, man, we'll just, you know, we'll just hang out. Uh, Katie Couric shows up and his interviews are fascinating. And one of the coolest parts about, about Dak Shepard in this podcast is that he's like a very, um, he's a very introspective guy. He's a sober guy.  And it seems to be that his is like his podcast like borders on self-help. They attack like a lot of he's when you say sober, you mean he doesn't, he doesn't drink. Yeah. He, no, he's a, he's, he's an AA guy. He's very open about being an AA guy. He's yeah. Um, we're not, um, so his, his podcast borders on like almost self-help. Cause it's like a super introspective tackles, social issues, personal issues in these really, really fascinating podcast with people who you don't get to see that that intimate uh interaction with especially because it's with someone who they're friends with um it's been a fascinating podcast i highly recommend armchair expert and is is it is it theme like is there is there an expert theme to it or no so his whole thing is that because he considers himself an armchair expert uh that was like where the name of his podcast came from he's just a dude who perpetuates and puts out these huge ideas with no data, facts, or really any qualification to opine on the topic. Just like us. I'm not qualified to opine on anything besides like beer. And even then, that's questionable. So anyway, that's where ArmchairExpert came from. I've been listening to a lot of it. It's hilarious. When you laugh alone, that's a good sign. I frequently look like a crazy person driving down the road because I'm just laughing hysterically in my car driving. Highly recommend it.</td>

<td>Well, so I've been looking at, so there's a couple of things I was, uh, uh, into this week. And one of these first one, BS4Build is a YouTube channel.

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. Both, both native Oregonians. Andrew has spent some time.  other places in other places and I've spent some time here. Um, by and large. So, but B is for build is a fellow. His name is Chris. I don't know what his last name is, but he, uh, has a YouTube channel where he gets sort of older or, or beat up cars. Some of them are actually pretty new and, and builds them in his garage while starting in his garage. And I think he's got a shop space now. It still looks like his garage in my ride kind of thing. No. Well, yeah, actually, Um, but he's got this sort of build it philosophy, uh, instead of. Instead of buying a car, he's going to build the car he wants. So he's done like an RX seven in the past and, uh, some pretty cool cars, but his, his most recent build is, uh, is a build that he's doing for SEMA, the big, uh, annual car show. SEMA. I can't remember what SEMA is. It's like special equipment. Um, but anyway, so he's been building a car.  They purchased a wrecked BMW M5 V10. It's got a jumping off point. And they have stuffed the BMW M5 drivetrain in a classic Datsun 240Z chassis. I think they rebuilt the chassis, but body. So you've got this teeny little car with a huge V10 in it.  And this last week, they've sort of been preparing for SEMA. When you listen to this, I think SEMA will probably be over already. Probably, yeah. So the last few episodes have come out this week. It's been really exciting to see them sort of scramble. The YouTube channel is really just him, but along the way he's picked up, he's got a fellow named Eric who comes in and helps him with welding. And then they picked up a guy named Oscar along the way. You know, these just guys, I assume he's paying them because they come consistently enough that they must be getting money.  Anyway, super cool. They're sort of at the conclusion of that build right now. You can go back and watch them all.</td>

He uses Harbor Freight tools like He's got a Harbor Freight bandsaw and you know all these Harbor Freight tools It's really the idea is I'm gonna try to do something that you could do at home And it's not instructional necessarily. It's more and more aspirational. I'm doing it. There's a lot of Stop-motion what's not stop-motion time lapse.</td>

Anyway, I've got an old Winchester Model 12 and I broke it. I don't know much about guns. Andrew and I are both sort of in a world where guns are something we do, I don't know anything about guns.

But about the development of the game Asteroids, which is Atari's best selling game ever. Super interesting. ArcadeBlogger.com, you can look it up. I won't tell you a lot more about it. But just sort of the development of this thing, at least for me, that was just sort of on the very beginning of my consciousness. Um, you know, my, my dad had played it and kind of introduced me to it on his Atari game system that we had in the house. And, uh, it was just interesting. It's a totally different world. You know, they developed the first thing they did to make the game was, uh, develop the hardware. They didn't, they didn't start with software. They, they had to make the, They had to make the platform for it. Yeah. The computer to do it, which is cool. Anyway, super interesting article. And that's that's that.</td>
