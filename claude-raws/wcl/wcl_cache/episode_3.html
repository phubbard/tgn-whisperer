<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This is a podcast about watches, food, drinks, and other topics of interest to the hosts. They discuss what constitutes a "reach watch" for them - a watch that would require significant justification and saving to purchase. Each host shares 3 watches they consider reach watches at their current level of watch collecting, explaining why those particular models appeal to them and the thought process behind acquiring them. They also discuss other related topics like buying straps, mispronouncing brand names, and listener corrections from previous episodes.</p>

<td>Hello fellow watch lovers, nerds, enthusiasts, or however you identify. This is the 40 in 20 podcast with your host Andrew and my good friend Everett. Here we talk about watches, food, drinks, and other things we like. Thanks for joining us today. Everett, how are you? I'm doing awesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Uh, Saturday, I had some donuts. I had cinnamon rolls. Cinnamon rolls? Yeah. Like homemade cinnamon rolls? No, out of the tube. Oh, so you, you cut the tube open, put them on a pan and type a deal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>pie plate kim went on her uh saturday morning she walks with a friend on saturday morning i think they they call it their i think they call it running but they walking yeah uh but she usually brings home donuts for the kids and i try to sneak one so she brings home only two no that's the good news she brings home many more than two so and and i really like donuts who doesn't yeah actually i'm not the biggest donut fan i don't know that's weird</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>People comment on that routinely, about that it's weird that I don't like donuts that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>No, that is weird. I know. What is it you don't like about them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>They're too sweet, man. I'm confections. Like I, if I'm given the choice between a donut and a scone, I'm for some reason going to go with a scone because they're not as sweet. They're not like, I don't know. They're not as fluffy. I feel like donuts are so, which is, this is why people like donuts. They're, they're too fluffy for me. They, I feel like I'm eating like styrofoam. That's not dense. I don't know.  No real answer. They're just not for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I love them. They're my favorite, especially on Saturdays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I'll have cinnamon rolls. There's no competition there for confections.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, that's right. That's right. So yeah, we'll just make sure we get both. So yeah, we're here today. This is episode 3 of 40 in 20. Today we're talking about, I think something pretty cool. We're going to talk about reach watches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>for us in particular, right? That's how I took this as like, these are my reach watches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>And when we say reach watches, what we mean are watches that, uh, not something that you would normally buy, uh, watches part, part of what we're going to, part of what we're going to do is we're going to try to figure out what is a reach watch. We haven't really talked about this before. I mean, we have a little bit, obviously enough to plan the show, but what is it? What is it that we each consider a reach? Um, what's realistic, what's unrealistic. So, That's what we're doing today. Uh, before we get started, I, uh, do have one, one sort of follow up from episode two. Episode two was our three watch for $600 collections. We reached out to some, uh, we reached out to you guys and said, Hey, what would you do? What would you, if you had $600, what three watches we got thousands of submissions.  thousands we poured through them and and and narrowed it down to just two just two uh the the two folks that uh submitted i think pretty actually awesome uh awesome contributions to that uh one of them watch you seek user oversteer he submitted a a three watch six hundred dollar collection as if he were starting from scratch so took more the approach i did I'm Still, I don't know how it didn't make my list. Citizen Nighthawk was his second choice, and I think those float between 200 and 250, which is what Overseer said. Freaking cool watch. I've never held one, but supposedly that bracelet is one of the best affordable bracelets. Have you ever seen one of those? I haven't. I'm actually looking it up right now.  It's a aviator style, kind of a busy dial. I don't know that that watch is an everyday watch. Certainly not, uh, certainly not an all day, everyday watch, but.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I think it could be though. Yeah. I think it just kind of depends on the environment you're in. And I mean, I sell beer. I could, I could pretty comfortably wear that every day. I like having a waterproof watch. I took a beer bath Thursday. I was changing a keg. Like a therapeutic beer bath. Yeah. Like just dunked myself in, uh, changing a keg and was very glad that I was wearing the Mako that day because I was moist. Damp. Like just wet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>No more of that. The third watch, Overseer with Timex Waterberry. Mm-hmm. Freaking cool. Again, I'm really surprised that neither one of us got there. That's a cool watch. You know, I actually probably not inclined to buy most Timexes. There's a couple of them out there.  a watch So that rounds out his collection. I think he got up to about 590, almost 600 bucks. Dope. You got 600 bucks. Dope. Use it. Yeah. Uh, the other, the other user, uh, watch you seek user that, that gave us, uh, an item. He, this is an all quartz selection from the tie, I believe is how you say it, or it's 30, but I assume it's the tie. Watch you seek user, the tie.  And all quartz, 431 bucks is his total. Leaving money on the table, man. Leaving the money, I love it. So three watches, the Victorinox 24, 241, 291. There's no name for this. Victorinox I don't think are like Seiko's where people give them nicknames, but this is a everyday quartz, braceleted field watch.  Sick, it's awesome. I think if you're if you're not dying for If you're not dying for an automatic movement that it's a it's a super cool watch the bracelet looks phenomenal size is good Victorinox is obviously a great brand Love it second choice a watch. I don't know a whole lot about a foibos. I assume that's how you say it or maybe it's Phoebus PX002A It's a 42 millimeter sub-homage dive watch. I think they have 300 meters of water resistance, Ronda 515. I don't know. Not a watch that's ever been on my radar. And for 119 bucks, 120 bucks, I think they're pretty cool. I actually didn't find the 002A for sale. I found the 002B for sale.  Which is sort of this dark blue... Gosh, I don't know. Without having seen one in person, I couldn't think of anything bad to say about it besides it's a fairly generic sub-homage. And also, his third choice was a G-Shock DW5750, $80 G-Shock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Another one, I'm surprised it didn't make either of our lists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, you know, I think we both probably floated 5600s, which would be... That would be the watch I'd go for. The 5750 is a more rounded...  um watch like case uh the the 5600 is that square or rectangular model so yeah i like that foibos logo that's that octopus with a crown that's like the like cthulhu yeah is that how you say that cthulhu how how often do you think it's going to happen that we're going to say things for the first time on the show and then doubt ourselves every time we say anything i say i doubt myself even when i'm not being recorded and broadcasted So we got a comment this week. I'm not going to name the user, but he's, he said, repeat after me Vostok, not Vostok. Oh shit. I didn't know. Vostok. Okay. Yeah. Now we know. I knew we were going to pronounce things wrong, like Jaeger LeCoultre. Uh, but I did not assume it would be a brand like Vostok that's ubiquitous and sort of something we've talked about a number of times.  Uh, you know, sometimes it just doesn't occur to you that you're saying something wrong when you've only ever read it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. And I think part of that is the, the making English of a, of a word that's not English. Like when I'm in an Italian restaurant, I don't emphasize Italian words. I say it. Bruschetta. Yeah. I don't, I don't. Right. Even though that's how you say it. You call it fucking bruschetta, asshole. Yeah. And that's cause that's well, A, I'm an asshole. So I'm like, that's me, uh, but I'm, I don't, I don't change the way I speak to cater to how it should be said in another language. Like I, I speak Arabic and when I say Arabic words, I still say them like when I'm speaking in English, I still say them as though I'm speaking English. Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Like I don't, you don't turn up the accent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah. I don't turn it up just cause I speak the language doesn't mean I have to use it in English. I don't know. Maybe that's it. I could be completely wrong about Vostok, but yeah, that's my, that's my assumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I, uh, I've never thought about it. I'm probably not gonna worry about it. I'll mispronounce it in the future. Sorry. Oversteer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Uh, we'll try. I mispronounce all kinds of things. That's not, that's just going to be number one, 10,000 on the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>We're going to fuck it up. You guys feel free to send in your corrections. So, um, yeah, we're just two guys drinking beer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So, uh, what do you think you want to get to the main topic? Yeah. Shall we? I think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So reach watches. Yeah. Here's how I defined it. It's pretty simple. Something I'm gonna have to pitch to my wife more than one time, probably in excess of five times and be, and have like a separate location to store money to purchase it. Cause you can buy a watch on a whim. You can be like, Hey, I'm going to, I'm going to buy this watch. It's 150 bucks. I did that this morning. I bought the Bambino this morning.  Booyah! Got it! So it'll be in the mail probably Monday. And there was no batting of her eyes. But if I said, hey, I'm going to spend $600 on a watch today, there'd be two eyebrows raised and a conversation. Right. So that's how I define a reach watch. And then also part of it is I was defining a reach watch for me, what a reach watch is. So I don't have a vast collection of watches in excess of even $300. So for me, every watch you buy is a Reach watch the first time you buy it. So the Citizen Aviator was a Reach. I think I paid $180 for it. Right. And for my first watch, that was a stretch. Because you can go to Walmart and you can pick up a watch for $45.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Or even Macy's, you can pick up a Fossil or a Skagen for $100-ish. Exactly. So to... Skagen. It's pronounced Skagen. I don't know what it's called. Skagen. Who knows? Weird word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>But that was, that was how I looked at it. So my first watch was my first reach watch at under $200. Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Same for me with the SKX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right. So because to spend that kind of money on a watch, something that seems, especially to your partner, it's like, what do you, what do you, what, what, what? You have to spend that much money on, on a, on a watch. What does it do? Right. So that was kind of how I took it. So every watch I buy for the most part when I'm, when I'm, Stretching a little bit is a reach watch. So right now for me, a reach watch would be in excess of $400. But for the purpose of this episode, I went greater than $500 is going to require multiple sales pitches because selling starts at no. And I know the first time I say, Hey, I'm going to get a strella cosmos for 703 bucks. I'm not going to get a yes. Right? Like I just know that a yes is not what follows that thought. So for me, that's my first reach watch the strella cosmos.  the C038LAS. It's 542 euros. As of yesterday, that converts to $703. That's beautiful. And the reason I picked this is it was the first watch that I saw of this style that really stuck out to me. And it wasn't even the Strela brand. It was the... Oh, shoot. It starts with a P.  Yeah, the pole shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, I think stroller and pole shot it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>They all kind of blended together. But that was that was the first watch I saw. And it's in that same kind of cream dial color. It's got really great tipped colored tips on the on the hands. And that was the first watch of this style that when I saw it, I was like, Oh, boy. Yeah, I need you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, these things are just, uh, ubiquitous, you know, any, any sort of discussion about affordable chronographs, they come up, um, because they're the, the history of the 3133 movement is so cool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Right. And the, and the, the, the passion behind the 3133, as I was, as I was looking at this watch, cause I, I've looked at them a lot. And as I looked at it, I, I started looking at the movements and started looking at, at the, the vastness of the 3133 and the wide appeal that it, that it has for people, whether it be people who just like Russian watches, people who like chronographs, people who they appeal to a really wide variety of folks. And this one made my list just on site. And then as I learned more about it, it got deeper and deeper into my, I need to add this watch. So this is actually a reach watch that I've had. I'm probably on sales pitch number eight, 10, for it and you're in the oh i'm in the throes of of making this pitch and making this sale i have yet to start the the sub savings and start like kicking money into it in my in my banking um because honestly i was kind of just hoping more yeah whatever that's not gonna happen that was stupid but right well what so that's interesting question what do you do uh how do you set aside money for watches what you know physically or or</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You know, what's your process for actually setting the money aside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So my money setting aside process is I think like anybody else's in saving for money. I have, you know, if I get a good bonus month when I have pay for travel, I take a piece of that and I throw it into usually into cash and then into a safe. Uh, it really should be going into just create a sub savings account named Estrella Cosmos. Right.  And that way I have it associated with it so I'm not dipping into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So your process is to get cash and to keep that cash aside. Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yes. So that's mine. It's discretionary income, money that I didn't expect to come in. So it's not even something I'm saving, that I budgeted for savings. It's a little bit slower process when you're counting on surprise money. Right. But I think that... Or it's faster. Yeah. Like where just one day, you know, money turns up.  you turn 16 into 600. Like that happens. Uh, that happened to me this week. I was, uh, doing some account support. Uh, we, we gathered at one of our accounts and we're drinking some beer in the, and after we finished our work day and, uh, two of my coworkers were playing video poker and I had 16 money in my wallet. I was like, all right, and I put it into the VP machine and this is not advocating that this is how you should make money. So we're clear. And I just was, hitting max bet max bet and I was down three bucks and I was like all right well this is my last bet and I hit 80 and I was like okay I'm gonna play it to 50 or I'm gonna play it to 100 because I'm not I haven't lost money here and the very next spin I won 600 money ding ding ding ding yeah so I let it run through its little cycle of pay me my money and then I cashed out right then and there that's not a great way to plan for saving for watches but I did buy a Bambino out of it so right right and what are you gonna do with the rest of it Well, we're going to Mexico in January.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Mexico! The first 40 in 20 field trip has already been planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Mexico. Yes. With the Ys. Yeah. And no kids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>None. Dude! Well, not our kids. There could be kids there, but they won't be ours. We don't have to worry about them. Yeah. Mine's going to my dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah, my mom's gonna come down and take care of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah, so that's where the rest of it's going. And had that not been on the horizon, I would have fully cashed in on my list of three watches for $600. Alright, you texted me and you were like, this is serendipity. It was. I told my wife that and she was actually on board. But then as I thought about it a little bit, I was like, you know what, we're going on vacation. As much as I would like these three watches, I can make a couple sales pitches and spend this money anyway, so I might as well take this surprise money and put it into vacation fun money. Yeah, it makes sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You know, I take, uh, so I do, I, I'm actually similar in that I'll, uh, set cash aside for my, my watch purchases, you know, and it's not always just surprise money. Sometimes I'll just, I'll pull out 40 bucks from a paycheck, uh, and set it aside. What I want, what I wind up doing with that, cause I don't want to have a big pile of cash hanging around. It just seems like easy to lose or, you know, whatever, but, I put it into PayPal so you can go, you can actually take cash and submit it to PayPal. There's a little fee. I don't know how much it is. If you wait till you have three or 400, it's like a buck 50 or two bucks or something like that. Where do you take your money to give it to PayPal? Um, BuyMart does it or not BuyMart, uh, Rite Aid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I think 7-Eleven does it. I usually go to Rite Aid because there's a pharmacy right down the street. Uh, there's a little, the app pops up a little, I think it's a QR code and they scan the QR code, you hand them the money and then it's like magic. It just shows up in your PayPal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So I usually have cash because my bank doesn't have any branches here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. Well, I mean us, us either. Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Cause we use, we use USA too. Oh yeah. Then that's yeah. So we don't have any branches here. And I did this morning, I searched for banks where they like, you can make deposits. There was none.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>No, it's hard to do cash deposits in the USA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I feel like there's got to be a way.</td>

So this is number two, the Marine Classic 40 millimeter with Arabic numerals. The Roman numerals don't.  do it for me. I don't know why. I have yet to see a dial that Roman numerals really seem to be what I want. And I can recognize that they look good, but they're not for me. Maybe yet. Maybe they'll grow on me. Maybe I'll see a watch and be like, whoo! You've got Roman numerals and I want you.</td>

<td>That's interesting. I was thinking about that this week.  the roman numerals i wind up being okay with are california dials type type roman numerals which i think california dial in and of itself is a little controversial but the i like the sans serif sort of um contemporary font roman numerals or at least i don't mind them uh but anything with like a heavily serif sort of or early 20th century or late 19th century font style. I'm not into it. I don't dig it.</td>

I like the history of this of this brand being a really old a German watchmaker, a brand that's grown, a brand that's been reinvented. Well, so I don't know. I mean, what, tell me. So they started in like 1927, um, doing, I think doing pocket watches was really what, I mean, at the time was really where it began. And they did a lot of, um, watches for the German military. Uh, their, their factory in Germany was destroyed by allied forces during World War II. Uh, they had to move.  And then I want to say, I read this either last night or this morning, I can't remember, I don't remember the date, but in relatively recent history, like in the last 40 years, brought on a new head watchmaker and kind of reinvented the brand and brought it back to the mainstream.</td>

Um, and that's, that's something that I like and it's a relatively affordable, um, watch that I know is going to be a very quality time piece. It's going to be, um, something that looks good.

<td>I was at work the other day and I saw someone do the wrist jiggle. I was like, uh-oh, uh-oh. And I caught a peek of his watch and I was like, is that an Orient? Was it? Yeah, it was an Orient. You can recognize the Orient logo pretty well on a dial, even at a mild distance, five, seven feet. We got to talk about watches, and I happened to be wearing my Mako that day.  Bullshit a little bit about orient watches and he actually had gotten his gift, which then kind of propelled him into learning about the watch that he had, like why it had stopped running when he wasn't wearing it and got into the, a little bit into understanding watches, but definitely conversation that wouldn't have occurred if I didn't recognize the, the wrist jiggle. Right. So I guess we'll move on to my third reach watch. Um, The Shinola Runwell Chrono. Ringing in at $750. I think that's actually the most expensive one on the list. What did this, this Strelok come in at? $703. Yeah, so the most expensive one on the list. And another watch. So what you'll see in each of these three watches is there's something that... The reason I could justify them being a Reach watch and spending in excess of $600 on a watch is because it's something that's kind of special to me. There's some sentiment already associated with with the brand or with that watch. So Stova came in like Strela was the first watch that I saw that I was like, holy shit, that's a beautiful watch. I need to have that watch. The Stova was one of the first watches that I saw strolling, like scrolling through Instagram as I kind of got interested in watches and started following watch brands like them and Hamilton were two watches that just like they stood out. There was something special about it and maybe there's not anything special about either of those brands.  But the way they resonated with me is, and then.</td>

<td>No, I didn't get them. I got, So, A, I went to Cabela's this morning to buy duck calls because I know I have some somewhere, but they could be anywhere. So I was like, you know what? Forget it. I'm just going to go buy some duck calls. I bought a set. It was a goose call and a duck call that was on sale. Two for one. Well, I mean, Bogo. Maybe. I don't know. It wasn't it wasn't like buying two. Yeah, I guess so. Whatever.  A combo pack, if you will. Because they were on sale. And in all likelihood, all of my future waterfowl call purchases will be that brand. Until some other brand comes in and gets me through their marketing and says, hey, this is the duck call that's going to bring them from all over the world to you.  But until then, I will probably be using that Duck Call brand because that first one that you get, there's always some kind of unique relationship to that brand. I still use Primos Elk Calls. I know they're not the best elk calls in the world, but they work for me. They're the first elk calls that I bought. They're what I learned to call elk on. I've found success with them for the most part. And you're comfortable. And I'm comfortable with them. I like them and I'm a creature of habit. So for me to go out and buy a different brand or a different package even would make me a little bit uncomfortable. Sure. Without like very noticeable results immediately. So that being said, I'm a pretty sentimental guy in that regard when it comes to brand support.</td>

Like there's something maybe or maybe not special about this brand, but I'm, I like them. I like the way they look. I like what they, what they market themselves as. Uh, and I'm, I'm into it. So this is the, the chronograph. I like the dial is just, it's a, it's a cool looking watch. It's a special watch to me, even though I've never worn it, I've never touched one.

I've got maybe not quite as positive an outlook.  But really, at the end of the day, if you're taking time and being considerate and really thinking about, you know, what is Shinola? What are they're trying to do? I think that there's a lot of good things. You know, there was this idea that Shinola was American made, and then they maybe had to back off of that.

I have a drawer full of sport watches like that, that I paid no money for. And then I, then I spent a little bit of money on one and have replaced the battery. Well, I had lunch with a client.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Um, it's been several months now, but I had lunch with a client who's wearing one of these and it was actually a, uh, a gold-plated version, blue dial, gold plating, the same watch, but with some minor differences. And I had asked him about it, and he was pretty aloof with his response. I don't know if it had been a gift or if it had been an impulse purchase. For me, and obviously for you, as this is a Reach watch, it wouldn't be those things. It wouldn't be an impulse purchase. It occurred to me that maybe it was for him.  It's interesting. I think Shinola, Shinola, Shinola, we're gonna... Chicago. We need your help, America. Or, man, a lot of folks in the UK listening. Some folks in France. Hey, UK, can you tell us... Hey, world. Is it Shinola, Shinola? Maybe Shinola. Shit in Shinola. I don't know. Detroit, man. It's not Chicago.  so uh yeah no i think that they i think that shinola has this that's that's the trick you just sort of make it vague is it shinola shinola shinola it could go either way just breathe out while you say it um they've got this this brand that had that both appeals to to watch people and appeals to maybe the general public uh which i think that appeal to the general public is is part of what makes watch people feel a little, uh, a little sort of anxiety or what, what compels that like distancing that happens in the watch world. Like this is a watch that's marketed at, you know, client, you know, banker client who is not being thoughtful. It's not marketed to me who's being thoughtful about my purchase.</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It makes complete sense. And what we're looking at is two people in different stages of that watch purchasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>There's a desensitization that happens to pricing. When I bought, like we were talking about, our first watch purchase, your Citizen Aviator at $180 was painful. Same for my SKX. I could come home and say, hey, Kim, there's this $180 watch that I really want to buy. Can we do it next month? It can be like, Yeah, whatever. I did it this morning. So there's a desensitization that happens. And that is, I think I'm just further along in being desensitized. So, you know, I think about these entry level microbrand watches, most of them come in, you know, usually between 400 and 700, I think is a pretty I think so. Yeah. Yeah. NTH is, is, is sort of at that higher end. And then, you know, we've got some of the watches we've talked about lawyer or lawyer or Dan Henry, they come in at the lower end of that, but that's kind of the spectrum. Those to me are, are not what I'd consider reach watches. When I think about a reach watch, I'm thinking about a thousand dollars, 1200, 1300. Those are watches that I think I might get one of those someday, because I'll tell you right now, a sub, seven thousand dollar sub i'm not getting one i'm not getting one unless for instance i get hit by a car and i get a settlement or something like that one of those things you know um unless i just run into a stupid money i'm not and i'm not i think even then i'm gonna be hard pressed to be able to justify spending that kind of money yeah i'm not gonna spend seven thousand dollars on a watch it's not it's not where i am in my collection so If I think about what's the most expensive watch I'm going to buy, it's here. It's in this $1,000 to $1,500 range. I picked three watches. I don't know that we need to talk about each one of them in detail, but just sort of to go through what my thought process was. The first watch I've pulled up here is a Nomos Club Campus. This is a watch by a super cool company.  Nomos, I think, gets street cred from... Nomos? No, oh, it's maybe Nomos. Namos. Oh, I like that one better. This is a brand that gets, that gets nods from, you know, entry-level folks, you know, maybe not entry-level, but affordable folks, and the luxury watch crowd as well. The campus is their entry-level, selection and i've got a problem with the marketing here this watch is marketed as a watch for graduates and in fact if you go to the website it says the graduates club celebrating milestones in life let's be really clear this is a $1,500 watch uh those folks buying their kids $1,500 graduation watches are different than me very i did not grow up in that world no and if</td>

<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>If my parents got me a $1,500 watch when I graduated from any time I've graduated, I'd be offended because I want the money. Like, just give me the money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Well, I don't know if I would have been offended, but I mean, A, it wouldn't have been realistic in our family and B, it would have been bottom line. It's just not something that would have happened. That's not where we were as a family and it's not, it wouldn't have made sense. So I, I struggle a little bit with the marketing here. It makes me feel a little, a little wonky with that said, so put that in a, put that in a box, shut the box and step it back because this watch, holy cow, beautiful. Uh, they are a 50, it's a $1,500 watch. I can't remember exactly what it is. 15, well, 1500 for the, I think this is a 36 version or 1650 for the 38.  You can get them used, which is what I would do. Certainly if I was going to purchase one of these for closer to a thousand California dial again, controversial. Um, I think, I think it works really well. The, the font on the numbers is really contemporary San Seraf. It's got these funky colors, you know, it's kind of got a, uh, mint green and there's some pinks in there. Beautiful, super beautiful watch. Uh, Street cred for days. I love them. I really do like them. I like them a lot. Minus the, the, this is for graduates aspect. It almost makes me feel like I'm not supposed to get one, you know, you, you know, this is, this watch is too immature for me or something. I don't know. I don't feel that way. I can kind of see that. So, uh, uh, if, if I'm able to suspend my, if I'm able to suspend that part and I think I would be, I, I would certainly reach for this watch. It might not be my first choice, even though I've brought it up here first because of that thing, which I'll work on suspending that when I'm going to buy my first $1,100 watch, but I think it's great. The reason for me, this is a reach watch. The reason for me, I even consider this watch versus a, you know, I don't know what would be comparable. I mean, I guess this would fit a similar place in my collection as, as the Saurabh or, you know, I'm buying this to be an everyday, dressy enough for a suit, casual enough for a t-shirt or rolled up sleeves, whatever. You wear this thing, you know, you probably don't want to do yard work in this thing, but outside of that, there's... Although if you're getting one for graduation, you might be using it for yard work. That's right. So the other one, I've picked a couple of micro brands here, and we don't need to talk about these in detail, two watches in particular that have come up in my sort of watch ramblings the orion calamity which is orion's most recent maybe not most recent i think it's the most recent their most recent sort of release dive watch beautiful if you haven't looked at an orion calamity look at it because you will uh you'll drool they're 1500 bucks which is A lot of money. And I have looked now, since we've started talking about this topic, for one used. Haven't seen one pop up on Chrono24. That's a good sign. Haven't seen one pop up on WatchRecon. I know they're out there. I don't think you can find them used. And I'm not sure you can find them new. This is a pre-order only at this point. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Nick from Orion is someone I don't know at all.  He was in watch school. I think he maybe worked for a big watch brand at some point or maybe he was in watch school and started modding Seikos. That's what it is. He was modding watches. He was doing engraving and came out with his Orion field standard watch and then has transformed from being sort of a watch modder in watch school now to a maker of beautiful, beautiful timepieces. This is a nerd watch. This is a watch nerds watch. Um, I can't think of another watch that's more watch nerds watch than this one. It's, it's exclusive pricing. It is without any reasonable criticism. Uh, I mean you can criticize the design. It's got knurling on the, on the bezel edges and knurling on the crown, but, but design aspects aside, this watch is legit. Every, you know, he's, the ultimate watch nerd as he's putting himself through watch school, making a watch based on his idea of what makes a good watch, this thing is cool. The other one I picked, Manta Triumph. Manta is a brand that I think kind of popped up out of nowhere. I know that they were a brand that was trying to do a retail market segment and they eventually shifted to online sales. So when the Manta came out with their first watch, which wasn't the Triumph, I think their first watch was the Ocean King, if I'm remembering that right. And they were trying to get into dealers, to brick and mortar stores. And I think ultimately they found that you can't do that. No matter how good a watch you're making, you're not going to be able to do that. So they dropped their prices, I think almost in half and started selling direct to consumers in an online model. And their watches are phenomenal. They're cool.  The finishing on these things, I don't think is, I don't think there's another watch in this price range under, you know, maybe 2,000, 2,500 bucks that's coming anywhere near competing to this. The finishing is beautiful. All the beveled edges, the corners, the transitions are all stunning. That crown is beautiful. The dial work is beautiful.  $1,375 and I think closer to $1,500, $1,550 on a metal bracelet. That's a ton of money. For me, that's a ton of money. That is a reach. Yeah. I could do it. I'm going to have to have multiple conversations with my wife. Ten plus. I'm probably going to save for many months and it's going to be focused saving. Or play video lottery. Or play video lottery. Just one night at a client function. Unrealistic.  This so so I guess to round up. I've picked these three watches the mana Manta. Oh the blue on blue looks so good. So Manta actually is Owned by the same people run by the same people as the folks that make Everest watch straps and Everest watch straps are made by Or watch it watch straps rubber straps designed for Rolex is primarily I think and and I'm not sure it's exclusively Rolex but They are custom fit, curved and rubber straps. Uh, and they are like 300 bucks, 275, 300 bucks for an Everest strap to put on your, you know, $30,000 yacht master or whatever. Um, really cool. Not something that I'm going to, not something that's on my radar because yeah, it's not on my radar. Not yet, but they make, now they make watches. These watches are fantastic.  if you want so this is a problem i have and maybe there's a way to run around this and you know i i understand these guys are really accessible but let's say i get a get this on the metal bracelet but what i want to have is a black rubber strap to wear with it really realistic if i got this i'd want a bracelet because that is a gorgeous bracelet i also want to have black rubber strap so let's say i buy it on the bracelet because that's usually the best way to do something buy it on a bracelet go to buy a strap 225 bucks to buy a curved man rubber strap because it's an Everest strap. Whoo. I don't know. That that bugs me a little bit, right? It maybe I shouldn't say bugs me. It makes the whole thing feel like less accessible. This is not for me. Yeah, this is not for me. So when I'm thinking about when I'm thinking about reach watches, that's sort of where I am, you know, and that's not to say that buying something like an NTH, a $700 NTH sub wouldn't be a reach because it would be. Um, it would be right.</td>

<td>It had made my reach list. It had made your reach list. It would have. Yeah. Just, just given that price point, like when we look at the way we, the way we viewed reaching yours was like for me, like, Oh, Oh, Oh, but that is just the next step in you can only buy so many sub $300, sub $400, sub $500 watches before you have to move into that next price bracket. And I think that's just kind of the difference in where we're looking.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. Well, so any, any comments you guys have, we'd love to hear what, what do you guys think are reach watches when you, when you're thinking about, uh, when you're thinking about maybe your everyday budget. And when I say every day, you know, a watch that you are, are, are highlighting this year to buy, or, or maybe watches that would be above that, uh, a reach.  for you to buy this year. We'd love to get your feedback on that.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Yeah. No, I, uh, I've been eyeballing. I think I text messaged you at like two in the morning. It was a couple of weeks ago and I was like, bro, I need a seatbelt strap right now. I don't know what happened in my head. Something.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>All right. All right. Leaving that alone. Uh, I, I, I just, at some point got it in my head. I need a seatbelt NATO. I've been into NATO's probably the entire time I've been into watches. I, when I first started looking at watches, it was that SKX and it was this really organic, um, middle of the day, internet browsing session. You know, you, you stop working and start poking around, found the SKX.  You see all these photos of SKXs on Nados. It's like, that looks cool. You know, the, the combinations, you see people putting them on, on like the gray and black bond, quote unquote bond Nados. You see folks putting them on different colors of Nados. Like this is, this is it. This is how I get into watches. And not that that was the goal, but, It was, it was part of that process for me to get into watches, seeing folks with this watch that is, uh, something I'm going to be purchasing right now and putting on this variety of straps, green or blue or whatever, really attractive to me. It was almost immediately after, maybe in the next week or so, I'm not even sure that I had the watch in my hands yet that I found cheapest NATO straps, which is a brand that everybody's going to know.  Um, they have like, uh, yeah, right. They've got a, I think it's a five pack, a starter pack of, you know, there's a, a green and a, and a bond. There's a bond NATO in there and maybe, uh, I don't, I don't even remember.</td>

<td>Everett</td>
<td>It's a white, it's a white two stripe with a blue center stripe, a bond, a like a red, white and blue America, red, red and blue America, a black and a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>navy and red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>No, mine's two black and one red center stripe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>So I picked one of those up. The cheapest NATO straps, if you haven't tried them, they're totally fine. They're serviceable NATOs. There's nothing wrong with them. They suck though. The hardware sucks. The nylon itself is not... You get what you pay for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>You get what you pay for. So I paid 13 bucks for five NATO straps. I mean, come on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>I think mine was a little bit more than that, but not a lot, maybe 20, 23 or 24 bucks. So I purchased that, I put them on the SKX, and I was instantly underwhelmed. Instantly underwhelmed. And I think there's two factors to that. One, the SKX Jubilee is so good, and you don't expect it to be that good, I don't think, when you're buying that watch. And two, the hardware's bad, the nylon's bad, the SKX is heavy enough that it sort of moves on top of the nylon, So I didn't really I didn't really feel it. I had all these NATO's I bought more NATO's thinking I just don't have the right NATO's, but I'm still buying these Sub $10, you know these seven eight nine ten dollar NATO's which seem expensive when you're buying Straps for your watch that that's right. You know, it changed for me when I bought a blue shark It was a blue shark their standard NATO I the the OG nylon but with their beefier hardware that that was what really changed it for me um it was it's an 18 millimeter i still have it it's an 18 millimeter gray nato with their brushed hardware it's got their name signed in it i don't care about the name being signed in it but the hardware is the hardware is is well done it it's chunky but not overly so the nylon is nicer not by an order of magnitude, but it's just nicer. Everything's nicer. That really changed it for me, is seeing what a nice NATO can do. I've got a handful now of what I'd call nice NATOs, but what I didn't have is a seatbelt NATO. One of these luxury NATOs, maybe, I don't know. The first time I ever saw one was on an Omega. I think that's probably what the genesis of the seatbelt NATO was, when Omega came out with their NATO strap. People were like, that's different and cool.  Holy shit, I want one, but they're $175. You know, the NATO companies. And I don't know who it was. I know Phenomenato. Am I saying that right? Tomato? Tomato? Phenomenon? Phenomenon? Yeah. I don't know how else you'd say it. Toxic NATOs, Blue Shark, several companies, all sort of at once, it seemed like, came out with these higher-end luxury NATOs. And I was intrigued.  I didn't pull the trigger and I don't know why. There's no good reason for me to have not pulled the trigger. I recently saw, I think it was on Average Bros, um, Average Bros Instagram feed. They've been, uh, talking about these Haviston straps. I picked up a Haviston strap. I picked an 18 millimeter. Uh, I can't remember what the designation is. This thing is, it's kind of like a khaki in the middle and an olive drab on the, on the edges.  Seatbeltnado style. It's their A2 version, their second iteration. It's a single pass. So instead of doubling the material under the watch, it's just a single pass through. Good Lord. It's so comfortable. This thing is incredible, man. I've put this, I really only have two watches that I wear on an 18 millimeter. I've got my SNK 809, the black SNK, and I've got my HKA 1963 chronograph.  Both of those things on this, on this strap are, it's like, this is it. This is the strap that was made for this watch or, or vice versa. Supernatural. Um, and they look phenomenal and it feels so good.</td>

<td>First thing you notice is that they have structure and they're soft. Somehow they've, they have joined those two things. Cause often you put on a really well structured nylon strap and it feels it.  Yeah. It feels like you're wearing malleable plastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Right. They're really chunky and uncomfortable. But that is not that. You know, I don't know. I don't know exactly all the all the the engineering or the the physical the physics that go into this thing. But it's silky smooth. I think that that's probably the best way to describe it in my mind is it's it's just silky. I do notice that there is a difference between the weave on the inner portion that that khaki portion and the outer olive drab portion. I'm not sure if it's a different material or if it's a termination that makes it feel a little different, but it's a different feel as you transition out. It's also weird. I'm not sure if it's.</td>

<td>too polite to say i'm glad i waited to pass judgment until i saw it because that metallic sheen that you see in photographs of it is just not there and it's gorgeous i mean to the extent it is it's gorgeous it's uh it's got it's shiny it's yeah it's great it's great get one if they're i don't know 28 bucks i think is what i paid for this uh it took a little bit of time to get here maybe seven days or so they were really responsive i think i emailed them after i ordered it because i'm the I'm like a helicopter parent with my shipping orders. They were really nice. Great, fantastic, beautiful, wonderful. The hardware. I actually was a little bit suspicious of the hardware. I'm going to hand this to you. I was suspicious of the hardware when I ordered it because it's hard to make out from pictures how nice this hardware is going to be. And I'd heard people talking it up. It's so good.  the buckle in and of itself. I'm not sure. It's not easy to put into words why it's good because it's just good. It's objectively good.</td>

<td>And it's thick without being chunky. Yeah.  It's, it's, it's both thick and unobtrusive. You know, I see those Panerai, uh, Panerai style buckles that are really sort of wide. I'm sure I wouldn't like that. This is not like that. It's thick and substantial, but also really unobtrusive, super comfortable. The edges are rounded. Super good. If he, that, that noise was me doing the like side of my mouth cluck with a, with a okay sign. Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic. Really good.  I'm a believer. I'm a believer. I'm going to start pimping the heck out of these things because they're fantastic. So what are you wearing today?</td>

They both feel good. I like the bracelet on the SKX a lot more. Yeah, because actually this on my drive over, it pulled my arm hair. I was annoyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>Uh, uh, that, you know, this is a conversation I have in my head quite a bit. And that's how nerdy I am that I think about these things on a day to day basis.  The SKX is ubiquitous. I think the SKX probably sells 2 to 1, 3 to 1 versus Mako would be my guess. That's probably a safe guess. And I think, I assume that's Orient, Mako, Orient Ray, USA, the full spectrum of everything that I would drop all those into the Mako. I still bet SKX outsells up by quite a bit. There's something about the SKX that is intangible. It's sexy in a way that the Mako is not. But with that said, I think the Mako is better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I like the angled bezel on the Mako a lot more. I don't like how square the bezel is on the SKX. Just for me, in the way that what I want in a watch, it's got a much taller profile that I... And that's subjective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>For me. That's subjective. I think objectively the Mako is better. I think that, especially the 2 iteration, the Mako 2 with hacking, hand winding. It hand winds, right? I think so.  What I wear it I've got in your hand I wear it often enough that I've never I mean, it's just it's it's a little bit all the tolerances are tighter You know when you turn that hundred and twenty click bezel around it lines up it lines up Objectively better watch but subjectively for me. It's still the skx.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>So we take your pick. Perhaps your coke or RC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>We could throw something in there that's the RC, yeah. Is Royal Crown a national brand? If we talk about Royal Crown, does everybody know what that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I just, I don't see a world where it's not, because I, here it is again, I like RC to all, to the other two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>You prefer RC? I do, I don't know why. So there is a brand that's at least still modestly prevalent out here in the Northwest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>It's West Coast wide. I think RC has to be, because it was started in Georgia. RC was? Yeah, I want to say Athens. I don't know why Athens sticks out.  But it could be Atlanta, because they both start with A's. But Royal Crown is a telephone here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>The only chain I can think of that still sells Royal Crown is McMinneman's. So there's a chain of a brewery chain out here. It's a sort of brew pub chain. And they have really cool campuses. They've got hotels and golf courses and movie theaters. That's right. It's all very independent, hipster-y and good.  Columbus, Georgia. It's a national soda. Okay. So the only place I know of that still sells RC is McMinneman's, but I'm, I'm sure there's more places in, well, maybe not. Maybe they're exclusive. It's the McMinneman's brand now. Used to be prevalent. Not anymore. I don't like it. It's pretty sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everett</td>
<td>I like it. I prefer it to the other two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andrew</td>
<td>He doesn't like donuts, but he likes. I know, right? I'm a disaster. I think we're getting really close. We're going to wrap up you guys probably a little long.  A couple of listener corrections we want to make. Um, watch you seek user. The tie says, if you guys know what watches you will discuss ahead of time, please double check the specs movements and whatnot. An example is where you said in episode one that the deep blue NATO diver has an NH 35. It's an NH 36. Totally true. That's a mistake. I think, uh, I almost find those two movements interchangeable, NH36 has a date complication, NH35 just a date. Second listener correction. At some point in episode two, I referred to hooded lugs on the Skrfa Diver 1. As I sit here today, I have no clue what I was talking about. I apologize. The Skrfa Diver 1 doesn't have hooded lugs. I knew that. I know that. I'm not sure what I was referring to. I was probably trying to say something really important. It's gone.  Thank you for joining us for this third episode of 40 in 20. Don't forget to tune back in next Thursday for another hour of watches, food, drinks, life, and other things we like.</td>
