# For each episode, we download the MP3, convert it to wav then run the model on it.
# Once that's done, we convert the output to markdown and deploy it to the site.
# Made much simpler by having a JSON config file (fields extracted via jq) and
# fixed filenames for each step of the process.

# FIXME - append deploy once thats fixed
