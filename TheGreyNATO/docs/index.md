# Welcome to TGN Transcribed!

![TGN logo](img/logo.png "TGN logo")

This is a collection of transcribed episodes of [The Grey NATO podcast](https://thegreynato.com). 

The Grey NATO, often referred to as 'TGN', is a podcast about adventure, travel, gear, and most certainly watches. Hosted by James Stacey & Jason Heaton.

This site is an unaffiliated side project, aiming to provide good-enough transcripts of the episodes plus the per-episode
links and show notes.

## How it works

[Full source code is on github](https://github.com/phubbard/tgn-whisperer) - unix tools, some python and a Makefile. The 
key tech is the [whisper.cpp project](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for speech-to-text.
