|Jason Heaton| Hello and welcome to another episode of The Gray Nato. |
|James|It's a loose discussion of travel, diving, driving gear, and most certainly watches, but not this week or the next as we're taking the next couple of weeks off for a little summer break. |
|Jason Heaton|So for August 8th and 15th, don't plan on a new episode hitting your feed and just imagine James and I on a beach sipping a drink that legally has to include an umbrella. But actually in all reality, I'll probably be doing planks and James will be napping in a hammock at his cottage. |
|James| Thank you so much for your understanding of this break. We try and do it every August. It just gives us a little bit of a chance to rethink, you know, what the plan is going to be for the future. And we thank you all for your continued support of TGN. We are thrilled to have you in the audience and we have some fun stuff right on the horizon. We'll be back on the 22nd of August with episode 296 and we'll chat to you then. |
