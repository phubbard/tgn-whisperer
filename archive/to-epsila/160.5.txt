|James| Hey everyone, James here with a quick message that we're taking this week off. While there's no cause for any alarm, Jason had to undergo emergency surgery recently, and while he is thankfully on the mend and doing okay, we both agreed that a week off made sense. To that end, I have some homework for you, as Jason and I would love to get some topic suggestions for future episodes. Simply hit up the show notes linked in the description or at notes.thegrenero.com and leave us suggestions in the comment section.  Thanks so much for listening and for your understanding of this skipped episode. I and a now gallbladder free Jason will be back next week with a fresh new episode. |
|Jason|Until then, if you're missing Jason and me, don't forget that you can catch Jason on the latest episode of the Standard H podcast and me on the latest episode of the Worn and Wound podcast. So be sure to check that out and hit the show notes if you have a fun idea for a future show topic. Chat to you next week. |
