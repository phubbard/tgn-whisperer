Hello and welcome to another episode of the Graynado, a loose discussion of travel, adventure, diving, gear, and most certainly watches. This is episode 65, and in all honesty, it's not really a full episode. Yeah, we just got to chatting recently and sort of decided that, you know, with sort of a coming together of several sort of busy  weeks on both of our ends. We would maybe take the month of August off, maybe a little bit into September and kind of regroup then and discuss, you know, kind of which direction TGN takes in the future and, you know, just give us some time to kind of get caught up on some other things in the interim. So I guess you'd call this a TGN summer vacation.  Yeah, I think we need a little bit of a break. I think the show's been going fairly well. I would like to have some sort of a thoughtful process as to maybe how we could improve the show. And obviously, if anyone has any ideas or suggestions, thegraynadoatgmail.com, we're open to that. If there's shows that you think stood out for you or ones you would rather us not repeat, then that's great. But I think the show right now needs to obviously continue, but we need a little break in the process. And I think just holding on to that last  Month, month and a bit of summer is probably the best way to do and we can come back fresh in September at some point. Obviously, stay tuned to the Instagram for any further news and otherwise we will catch you kind of on the other side of a short break. But I think it's a good time to consider what we could all be doing with our time while the weather, assuming you're in the Northern Hemisphere, is kind of on your side. Jason, what do you think a few things that people should do  instead of waiting for another episode of Grey Natal for the next little while. Well, you know, judging from what we hear from listeners on a fairly regular basis, as well as a lot of the topics that we've been discussing in the past several months, I would say, you know, pick up a new hobby or a new endeavor like film photography. You know, you recently got your film SLR, your Canon. It's kind of a cheap and really fun way to just try something new and kind of  hone your photography skills. Um, a lot of people have written into us over, you know, the past couple of years, to be honest, and, and thanked us for kind of inspiring them to try something new like a scuba diving. And, and that's great. Cause I think, you know, it's a sport both of us love. And I think, uh, as kind of watch lovers, there's definitely a dive watch tie in. So, you know, maybe this is a good month. Um, yeah, like you said, assuming it's in the Northern hemisphere and you're doing it closer to home,  to get in the pool, sign up for that PADI course or NAUI course and learn to dive if you don't know already. And who knows, it might change your life, you know? Yeah. And the water is probably a little bit warmer now than it's going to be other times in the year. And it might even be a scenario where you've got a friend who's kind of on the fence, but you wanted to do the course with them, you know, sneak them into it that way. It's still hot out. They're going to want to be in the pool anyways, or they're going to be around the water for the balance of the summer. I think that's a great option. Obviously go hiking. Yeah.  You know, Explore Magazine. So that's explore-mag.com. They have actually a ton of posts about various spots in Canada where you can go hiking. And some of them are spots you wouldn't necessarily think that there's great hiking. Ontario, you know, the prairies, things like that. So while obviously that's Canada specific, keep in mind that, of course, there's probably hiking almost anywhere near you. And maybe some of you haven't explored that. Do some hiking, maybe do some camping. You know, try and fill those days with mini adventures if you can, whether that's  picking up a camera and hiking or maybe, you know, getting into diving or something like that. I think those are good, good options. The last one I would suggest is you've got a little bit of extra light in the evenings, maybe stay up a little later and catch up on a book you've always wanted to read. Jason, are you reading anything you really like? You know, I just finished that Ship of Gold book that I recommended, I think, in the last episode and I can't recommend it enough. I passed it on to my dad and I think he's reading it now. And, um, it's, it's a good summer read. So I'm, I'm kind of on the scout for, for my next one. So certainly, uh,  listeners, if you send me a DM or both of us with any book recommendations, summer is a great time to kick back and check out new books. Sure. And if we were to dig through a few TGN classic books, I think you could do really well with Shadow Divers. That's probably the number one book we've spoken about the most. I explained it to a few people this past week. I spent a week in New York City with the Hodinkee staff, and I found myself telling quite a few people about that book. It's funny because it's one I read many years ago now, and it still has such an effect.  Yeah, that or something like Krakauer's Eiger Dreams, which is kind of a collection of mountaineering stories from him. So if you kind of want to do a diving book and then follow it up with a good mountaineering book, that's another good one. Yeah. And if you want to go even further into the alpinism side of the mountaineering, then pick up Ed Veester's No Shortcuts to the Top. Has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Yeah. You can also do really well with a book I mentioned recently, which is Out There, The Wildest Stories from Outside Magazine.  So these are their stories of misadventure. I've talked about it on the show. It's been in previous show notes, definitely worth your time, super fun. And because it's essay style, if you're the type that opens a book, even a very good book and falls asleep a couple of minutes later, uh, I think this is a pretty good option. Maybe you can hit it in the afternoon before you're too tired. That's what I usually have to do. But, uh, out there is also a great choice. Cool. Yeah. All good choices. Um, all great sort of summer activities. And, uh, you know, if you're in the Southern hemisphere, I guess it's winter. Um,  But I mean, some of that still applies. You can still do some of this in the winter. Sure. Yeah. But yeah, go out there. Enjoy what's left of the next month, month and a bit. And we will be back with fresh episodes and maybe even a little bit of fine tuning to the show in the next little while. Yeah. Sounds great. Enjoy the rest of the summer. All right. Chat to you all soon. Yeah."}
