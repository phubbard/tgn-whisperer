## What is Hodinkee?

Hodinkee is a commerical site centered on wristwatch journalism. They have a podcast of the same name, 
[here on Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hodinkee-podcasts/id1412458259). 

## What is this site?
_This_ site, 'The Compleat Hodinkee', is an unaffiliated side project, aiming to provide

- Auto-generated transcripts of each episode
- Show notes and links
- A search engine across all the above

The title is a nod to the [Compleat Angler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compleat_Angler), a book by Izaak Walton, first published in 1653. (Chris Sohl suggests that it could also be a nod to [The Compleat Goggler](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Compleat-Goggler), 
a 1938 book by Guy Gilpatric who was an inspiration to Jacques Cousteau. I like that idea too.)

## How it works

[Full source code is on github](https://github.com/phubbard/tgn-whisperer) - unix tools, some python and a Makefile. 
I did a full writeup [here on my blog](https://ultracrepidarian.phfactor.net/2024/07/20/llms-can-solve-hard-problem/) if you'd like to know
how it all works.
