## What is this site?

The title is a nod to the [Compleat Angler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compleat_Angler), a book by Izaak Walton, first published in 1653. (Chris Sohl suggests that it could also be a nod to [The Compleat Goggler](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Compleat-Goggler), 
a 1938 book by Guy Gilpatric who was an inspiration to Jacques Cousteau. I like that idea too.)
