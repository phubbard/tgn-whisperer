## Welcome!

This is a collection of transcribed episodes of [The 40 and 20 podcast](https://watchclicker.com/4020-the-watch-clicker-podcast/):

> The 40&20 Podcast is a weekly podcast hosted by our partners Andrew and Everett. 
> The show is aimed at watch enthusiasts and focuses on affordable watches and the brands 
> that make them, the people and personalities in the community, as well as other topics 
> including food, drinks, life, and other things we like. 

*This* site, 'The Compleat 40 and 20', is an unaffiliated side project, aiming to provide good-enough transcripts of the episodes plus the per-episode
links and show notes. (And a search function. Important, that.)

The title is a nod to the [Compleat Angler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compleat_Angler), a book by Izaak Walton, first published in 1653.

(Chris Sohl suggests that it could also be a nod to [The Compleat Goggler](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Compleat-Goggler), 
a 1938 book by Guy Gilpatric who was an inspiration to Jacques Cousteau. I like that idea too.)

## Dive in and read

Each episode has its own page with transcript, episode page link and (coming soon!) show notes/links.

#### How it works

[Full source code is on github](https://github.com/phubbard/tgn-whisperer) - unix tools, some python and a Makefile. The 
key tech is the [whisper.cpp project](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for speech-to-text.

#### Contact me

If you have any issues with this site, please [open an issue on github](https://github.com/phubbard/tgn-whisperer/issues) and
I'll take a look. Note that I'm merely a user of the transcription model; I don't have the ability to add 
much-wanted features like speaker identification.
