## Welcome!

![TGN logo](img/logo.png "TGN logo")

This is a collection of transcribed episodes of [The Grey NATO podcast](https://thegreynato.com). 

The Grey NATO, often referred to as 'TGN', is a podcast about adventure, travel, gear, and most certainly watches, created and hosted by James Stacey & Jason Heaton.

This site, 'The Compleat TGN', is an unaffiliated side project, aiming to provide good-enough transcripts of the episodes plus the per-episode
links and show notes. (And a search function. Important, that.)

The title is a nod to the [Compleat Angler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Compleat_Angler), a book by Izaak Walton, first published in 1653. (Chris Sohl suggests that it could also be a nod to [The Compleat Goggler](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Compleat-Goggler), 
a 1938 book by Guy Gilpatric who was an inspiration to Jacques Cousteau. I like that idea too.)

## Dive in and read

Each episode has its own page with transcript, episode page link and (coming soon!) show notes/links.

#### How it works

[Full source code is on github](https://github.com/phubbard/tgn-whisperer) - unix tools, some python and a Makefile. The 
key tech _was_ the [whisper.cpp project](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) for speech-to-text. After getting the project working, I rewrote the code to 
use [WhisperX on OctoAI](https://octoai.cloud) which is able to discern individual voices for a much improved output.
